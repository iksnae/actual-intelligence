Image Description: ChatGPT Context Window Visualization

This image illustrates the concept of context window in a ChatGPT conversation. The visualization shows:

A conversation thread between a user and ChatGPT with multiple exchanges, resembling the actual interface

A semi-transparent blue highlight over the most recent 3-4 exchanges, representing the "active context window" that ChatGPT is primarily working with

Faded text for older exchanges at the top, indicating they may be partially out of the primary context (though still potentially accessible)

Small arrows or connecting lines showing how information in one message relates to questions or responses in subsequent messages

Call-out boxes with brief explanations of how context is maintained between related messages

This visualization helps readers understand how ChatGPT maintains conversation history within a limited window, demonstrating why context refreshing and management is important for longer conversations.
