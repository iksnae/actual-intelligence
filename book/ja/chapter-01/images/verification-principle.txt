A diagram showing verification levels based on stakes. Create a visual scale or pyramid showing three levels of verification needed: 1) Low stakes (minimal verification needed) for brainstorming or first drafts, 2) Medium stakes (careful review needed) for content that will be shared or used but isn't critical, and 3) High stakes (independent verification required) for important decisions or factual claims. Include brief examples of each level and appropriate verification approaches. The diagram should illustrate that as the importance or stakes increase, so should your verification efforts.
