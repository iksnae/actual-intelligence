An open notebook (or digital tablet with notes app) with blank spaces for answering the three reflection questions mentioned in the chapter: "What's one task in your daily life or work that feels repetitive or time-consuming?", "What's one topic you've been curious about but haven't had time to explore deeply?", and "What's one creative project you've wanted to try but haven't gotten around to?" The notebook should look inviting and personal, perhaps with some small doodles or visual elements around the edges.
