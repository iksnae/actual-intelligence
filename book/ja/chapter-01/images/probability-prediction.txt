A diagram showing how AI predicts the next word based on probability. Show a partial sentence: "The chef put the cake in the ___" followed by a probability distribution of possible next words, with "oven" having the highest probability, followed by lower probability options like "refrigerator," "display case," etc. Use a visual representation like a bar chart or percentages to show these varying probabilities. The diagram should be simple and clear enough for non-technical readers to understand.
