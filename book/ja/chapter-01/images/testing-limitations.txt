A person comparing AI responses to their own knowledge on a familiar topic. Show someone (representing "Robert" from the text) with astronomy-related items (telescope, star charts, astronomy books) comparing what they know about astronomy with responses from ChatGPT. They should be noting discrepancies or limitations, perhaps by marking AI responses that contain errors or outdated information. The scene should illustrate the process of critically testing AI against personal expertise.
