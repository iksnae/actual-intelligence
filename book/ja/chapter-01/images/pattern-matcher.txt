A visual representation showing AI as a pattern matcher. This diagram helps illustrate how modern AI systems like large language models work by recognizing and continuing patterns in their training data, rather than having true understanding or comprehension. The image shows various input patterns on one side and how the AI system predicts the most likely continuations on the other side.
