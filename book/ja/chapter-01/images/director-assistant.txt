A film director giving instructions to an assistant on a movie set. The director should be confidently pointing or gesturing to indicate their vision, while the assistant takes notes or listens attentively. This metaphor illustrates the human-AI relationship, with the human providing direction and creative decisions while the assistant helps execute the details.
