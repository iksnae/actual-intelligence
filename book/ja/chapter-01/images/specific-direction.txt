A side-by-side comparison showing: on the left, a vague prompt ("Give me some marketing ideas") leading to generic, broad AI suggestions; on the right, a specific, detailed prompt ("I run a local organic farm stand targeting health-conscious families. Suggest five low-budget marketing approaches that would help us emphasize our sustainable farming practices and community roots") leading to targeted, relevant, and useful AI suggestions. The visual should clearly illustrate how specificity in prompts dramatically improves the quality and relevance of AI outputs.
