Image Description: Director's Clapperboard

A close-up image of a hand holding a classic black and white film clapperboard, ready to call "action." The clapperboard has "ACTUAL INTELLIGENCE" written as the title and "DIRECTOR: YOU" as the director's name.

This image visually reinforces the metaphor that the user is the director of AI tools, making creative decisions and guiding the process, while AI serves as their production crew carrying out specific tasks.

The image should have a professional but accessible feel, appealing to non-technical readers while conveying the creative authority that comes with the director's role.

This visual connects directly to the film director metaphor introduced in Chapter 1 and reinforced in Chapter 2, providing continuity of the central theme that human judgment and direction remain essential when working with AI tools.
