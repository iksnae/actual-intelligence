## Creative Control

**Objective:** Practice maintaining ownership of a creative project while using AI as an assistant.


**What You'll Need:**

- Access to ChatGPT
- 20-30 minutes


**Instructions:**

1. Choose a simple creative project from the options below (or create your own):

   - Write a short story (300-500 words)
   - Plan a themed dinner party
   - Design a flyer for a community event
   - Create a workout routine

2. Begin by defining your vision for the project. Write down:

   - The main goal or purpose
   - Key elements you want to include
   - Your personal style or preferences
   - Any constraints or requirements

3. Create a series of specific requests for ChatGPT that will help you with different aspects of your project. Instead of asking it to complete the entire project, break it down into components where AI assistance would be helpful. For example, if writing a short story:

   - `Suggest three possible opening paragraphs for a story about...`
   - `Help me develop the main character who is...`
   - `Provide some descriptive language for the setting of...`

4. For each AI response, select elements you like, modify others, and discard those that don't fit your vision.

5. Assemble the final project yourself, integrating AI-assisted elements with your own contributions.

*"I used this approach to plan my daughter's birthday party,"* explains Wei, a busy parent. *"I had a dinosaur theme in mind but needed help with game ideas and decorations. Instead of asking for a complete party plan, I asked specific questions about each aspect and pieced together the elements I liked. The party felt like my creation, not something an AI made."*

**Reflection Questions:**

- How did breaking the project into specific requests help you maintain creative control?
- Which parts of the process benefited most from AI assistance?
- Which aspects required your human judgment and creativity?
- How does the final result reflect your vision and style, despite using AI assistance?
