## Activity 1: The Director's Chair

**Objective:** See how the specificity of your direction affects AI output.


**What You'll Need:**

- Access to ChatGPT (free account)
- 10-15 minutes


*"This activity was eye-opening,"* says Miguel (a high school teacher). *"I couldn't believe how different the responses were just by adding a few details to my question."*

**Instructions:**

1. Open ChatGPT and start a new conversation.

2. First, give a vague prompt and observe the response:

   `"Give me some advice."`

3. Now, try a slightly more specific prompt:
   
   `"Give me some advice about learning new skills."`

4. Finally, provide a highly specific prompt with context, constraints, and your goal:
   
   `"I'm a busy parent with two young children trying to learn basic Spanish in preparation for a family trip to Mexico in three months. I can only practice for about 15 minutes each day, usually while commuting on public transportation. Give me a realistic learning plan that fits these constraints and focuses on practical travel phrases."`

5. Compare the three responses. Notice how the quality and usefulness of the AI's output directly corresponds to the specificity of your direction.

**Reflection Questions:**

- Which response was most useful to you, and why?
- What specific elements of your detailed prompt led to improvements in the AI's response?
- How might you apply this principle of specificity to your own goals when using AI?
