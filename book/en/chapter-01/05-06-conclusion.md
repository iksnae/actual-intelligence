Remember that the concept of Actual Intelligence emphasizes that you—the human—are the essential intelligence in this partnership. The AI is a tool that amplifies your thinking, but the direction, purpose, and wisdom come from you.

*"Before trying these activities, I felt like AI was this mysterious thing I couldn't possibly understand,"* shares Jordan, a small business owner. *"Now I see it's just a tool—a powerful one, but still just a tool that I control. That shift in perspective has made all the difference."*

In the chapters ahead, we'll build on these foundations by exploring more specific applications and techniques for using AI tools effectively in various aspects of your life. We'll start by setting up your free ChatGPT account and walking through the basics of the interface, so you can begin applying what you've learned right away.

For now, take a moment to reflect on what you've discovered about the human-AI partnership and how you might start incorporating these tools into your life in ways that align with your goals and values.
