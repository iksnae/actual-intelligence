# What is "Actual Intelligence"? (The Human-AI Partnership)


In a world increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence, we often find ourselves wondering about our place alongside these powerful tools. The term "Actual Intelligence" might seem like yet another AI buzzword, but it represents something far more important: the unique and irreplaceable human intelligence that gives AI its purpose and direction.


**Actual Intelligence** is what happens when human wisdom, creativity, and judgment combine with AI capabilities to solve real problems. It's not about the tool—it's about how you use it.


Imagine a master carpenter with a collection of sophisticated power tools. The tools themselves, regardless of how advanced they are, cannot decide what to build or why it matters. They cannot determine if a table should be round or rectangular based on a family's specific needs. They cannot feel satisfaction when the finished piece brings joy to its new owners. This decision-making, purpose-finding, and meaning-creating ability is the domain of human intelligence—the actual intelligence that drives the entire process.


In the same way, AI tools like ChatGPT are incredibly sophisticated instruments that can process language, generate content, and help with various tasks—but they fundamentally lack the human spark that gives those tasks meaning and direction.

## The Partnership Model


Rather than thinking of AI as a replacement for human thinking, we invite you to consider a different model: the human-AI partnership. In this relationship:

- **You** provide the goals, values, creativity, and judgment
- **AI** provides computational power, information access, and task assistance


This partnership model places you—the human—firmly in the driver's seat. You are not just a passive user of AI but its director and purpose-giver. You are the intelligence that matters most.


Throughout this book, we'll refer to this partnership as "Actual Intelligence"—the powerful combination of human wisdom and AI capabilities working together to achieve goals that matter to you.


## Why This Distinction Matters


Understanding this relationship is not just a philosophical exercise—it has practical implications for how effectively you'll use AI tools:

1. It empowers you to take an active role rather than a passive one
2. It helps you set realistic expectations about what AI can and cannot do
3. It encourages you to develop the skills that remain uniquely human
4. It helps you maintain ownership of your work and ideas


As AI tools become increasingly embedded in our daily lives, those who understand how to direct them effectively—those who exercise their Actual Intelligence—will have an undeniable advantage.


## The Human Element


Consider Lisa, a middle school science teacher preparing lessons on climate change. She could simply ask ChatGPT to "create a climate change lesson for 7th graders" and use whatever it generates. That would be using AI as a replacement for her own thinking.


Instead, Lisa applies her Actual Intelligence. She knows her specific students—their knowledge levels, interests, and the local environmental issues they see every day. She understands which concepts they've struggled with in past lessons. She has educational goals beyond just conveying information—she wants to inspire curiosity and environmental stewardship.


With this human context that no AI could fully grasp, Lisa directs ChatGPT to create specific components that fit her vision: "Help me create an interactive demonstration that shows how greenhouse gases work, suitable for 7th graders who have already learned about the water cycle but struggle with abstract concepts."


The resulting lesson is far more effective because it combines Lisa's deep understanding of her students with the AI's ability to generate creative teaching ideas. That's Actual Intelligence at work—the human remains central to the process while leveraging AI as a powerful tool.


In the chapters ahead, we'll show you how to develop this partnership approach with AI tools, starting with the fundamentals and building to more advanced applications. But first, let's further explore the relationship between AI tools and human intelligence to set a solid foundation for our journey.
