## Myth vs. Reality

**Objective:** Test the limitations of AI to better understand where human intelligence remains essential.


**What You'll Need:**
- Access to ChatGPT
- Access to reliable information sources (websites, books, experts)
- 20-30 minutes


**Instructions:**

1. Choose a topic you know wellâ€”perhaps related to your profession, a hobby, or your local community.

2. Ask ChatGPT a series of increasingly specific questions about this topic, starting with general questions and moving toward highly specific ones that might require very recent or specialized knowledge.

3. Note which questions the AI answers accurately and which ones it struggles with or provides incorrect information for.

4. For at least one question where the AI provided incorrect or incomplete information, verify the correct information through reliable sources.

5. Ask the AI to explain its limitations regarding this topic. A prompt like this works well: 
   
   `"What limitations might you have in providing information about [your topic]? What aspects of this subject would be difficult for you to address accurately?"`

Robert, an amateur astronomer, tried this with his hobby: *"I was impressed with the AI's knowledge of basic astronomy concepts, but when I asked about specific deep-sky objects I've observed or recent discoveries, it either gave outdated information or made up details. It was actually quite honest about its limitations when I asked directly."*

**Reflection Questions:**

- At what point did the AI's knowledge or accuracy begin to break down?
- What types of questions seemed most challenging for the AI?
- How transparent was the AI about its limitations?
- How would you approach using AI for this topic in the future, knowing these limitations?
