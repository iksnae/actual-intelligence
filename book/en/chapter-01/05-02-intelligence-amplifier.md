## Intelligence Amplifier

**Objective:** Use AI as a thinking partner to amplify your own intelligence on a personal challenge.


**What You'll Need:**

- Access to ChatGPT
- A real problem or challenge you're currently facing
- 15-20 minutes


**Instructions:**

1. Identify a current challenge in your life that requires some thinking or planning. This could be a decision you need to make, a project you're planning, or a problem you're trying to solve. Choose something real but not extremely personal or sensitive.

2. Before consulting AI, spend 3-5 minutes writing down your own thoughts about the challenge:

   - What makes this challenging?
   - What approaches have you considered?
   - What constraints or considerations are important?

3. Now, craft a prompt that asks the AI to help you think through this challenge. Include:

   - A brief description of the situation
   - Your current thoughts and approaches
   - What specific type of help you want (brainstorming, organizing your thoughts, considering perspectives you might have missed, etc.)

4. Review the AI's response and identify at least one insight or idea you hadn't fully considered.

5. Follow up with at least one clarifying question or request based on the AI's response.

*"I used this approach when planning a career change,"* shares Tanisha, a former retail manager now working in healthcare administration. *"The AI didn't tell me what to do, but it helped me organize my thoughts and consider aspects I hadn't thought about, like what transferable skills I already had."*

**Reflection Questions:**

- How did the AI's response compare to your initial thinking?
- Did the AI help you see the problem from new angles?
- How did your specific knowledge of the situation help you evaluate the AI's suggestions?
- What role did you play versus what role did the AI play in this thinking partnership?
