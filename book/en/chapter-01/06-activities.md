# Activities: Taking Control of Your First AI Interactions

Now that we've established the foundation of Actual Intelligence—the powerful partnership between your human judgment and AI capabilities—let's put these concepts into practice with hands-on activities. These exercises are designed to help you develop your skills as an AI director while experiencing firsthand the importance of your role in guiding these tools.

## Activity 1: The Director's Chair

**Objective:** Experience how the specificity of your direction affects AI output.

**What You'll Need:**
- Access to ChatGPT (free account)
- 10-15 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Open ChatGPT and start a new conversation.

2. First, give a vague prompt and observe the response:
   *"Give me some advice."*

3. Now, try a slightly more specific prompt:
   *"Give me some advice about learning new skills."*

4. Finally, provide a highly specific prompt with context, constraints, and your goal:
   *"I'm a busy parent with two young children trying to learn basic Spanish in preparation for a family trip to Mexico in three months. I can only practice for about 15 minutes each day, usually while commuting on public transportation. Give me a realistic learning plan that fits these constraints and focuses on practical travel phrases."*

5. Compare the three responses. Notice how the quality and usefulness of the AI's output directly corresponds to the specificity of your direction.

**Reflection Questions:**
- Which response was most useful to you, and why?
- What specific elements of your detailed prompt led to improvements in the AI's response?
- How might you apply this principle of specificity to your own goals when using AI?

## Activity 2: Intelligence Amplifier

**Objective:** Use AI as a thinking partner to amplify your own intelligence on a personal challenge.

**What You'll Need:**
- Access to ChatGPT
- A real problem or challenge you're currently facing
- 15-20 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Identify a current challenge in your life that requires some thinking or planning. This could be a decision you need to make, a project you're planning, or a problem you're trying to solve. Choose something real but not extremely personal or sensitive.

2. Before consulting AI, spend 3-5 minutes writing down your own thoughts about the challenge:
   - What makes this challenging?
   - What approaches have you considered?
   - What constraints or considerations are important?

3. Now, craft a prompt that asks the AI to help you think through this challenge. Include:
   - A brief description of the situation
   - Your current thoughts and approaches
   - What specific type of help you want (brainstorming, organizing your thoughts, considering perspectives you might have missed, etc.)

4. Review the AI's response and identify at least one insight or idea you hadn't fully considered.

5. Follow up with at least one clarifying question or request based on the AI's response.

**Reflection Questions:**
- How did the AI's response compare to your initial thinking?
- Did the AI help you see the problem from new angles?
- How did your specific knowledge of the situation help you evaluate the AI's suggestions?
- What role did you play versus what role did the AI play in this thinking partnership?

## Activity 3: Myth vs. Reality

**Objective:** Test the limitations of AI to better understand where human intelligence remains essential.

**What You'll Need:**
- Access to ChatGPT
- Access to reliable information sources (websites, books, experts)
- 20-30 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a topic you know well—perhaps related to your profession, a hobby, or your local community.

2. Ask ChatGPT a series of increasingly specific questions about this topic, starting with general questions and moving toward highly specific ones that might require very recent or specialized knowledge.

3. Note which questions the AI answers accurately and which ones it struggles with or provides incorrect information for.

4. For at least one question where the AI provided incorrect or incomplete information, verify the correct information through reliable sources.

5. Ask the AI to explain its limitations regarding this topic. A prompt like this works well: "What limitations might you have in providing information about [your topic]? What aspects of this subject would be difficult for you to address accurately?"

**Reflection Questions:**
- At what point did the AI's knowledge or accuracy begin to break down?
- What types of questions seemed most challenging for the AI?
- How transparent was the AI about its limitations?
- How would you approach using AI for this topic in the future, knowing these limitations?

## Activity 4: Creative Control

**Objective:** Practice maintaining ownership of a creative project while using AI as an assistant.

**What You'll Need:**
- Access to ChatGPT
- 20-30 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a simple creative project from the options below (or create your own):
   - Write a short story (300-500 words)
   - Plan a themed dinner party
   - Design a flyer for a community event
   - Create a workout routine

2. Begin by defining your vision for the project. Write down:
   - The main goal or purpose
   - Key elements you want to include
   - Your personal style or preferences
   - Any constraints or requirements

3. Create a series of specific requests for ChatGPT that will help you with different aspects of your project. Instead of asking it to complete the entire project, break it down into components where AI assistance would be helpful. For example, if writing a short story:
   - "Suggest three possible opening paragraphs for a story about..."
   - "Help me develop the main character who is..."
   - "Provide some descriptive language for the setting of..."

4. For each AI response, select elements you like, modify others, and discard those that don't fit your vision.

5. Assemble the final project yourself, integrating AI-assisted elements with your own contributions.

**Reflection Questions:**
- How did breaking the project into specific requests help you maintain creative control?
- Which parts of the process benefited most from AI assistance?
- Which aspects required your human judgment and creativity?
- How does the final result reflect your vision and style, despite using AI assistance?

## Activity 5: Setting Your AI Compass

**Objective:** Develop personal guidelines for how you want to use AI in your life.

**What You'll Need:**
- Access to ChatGPT
- Paper and pen, or digital document
- 15-20 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Reflect on your values, goals, and the areas of your life where you think AI tools might be helpful. Consider:
   - What types of tasks do you find draining or time-consuming?
   - What skills would you like to develop, with AI as a learning aid?
   - What aspects of your thinking or work would you never want to outsource?

2. Ask ChatGPT for assistance in thinking through these questions with a prompt like:
   *"I'm developing personal guidelines for how I want to use AI tools like you in my life. Can you help me think through some questions to consider about where AI might be most helpful to me and where I might want to be cautious about using it? Consider aspects like learning, creativity, critical thinking, and practical tasks."*

3. Based on the AI's suggestions and your own reflection, draft 3-5 personal guidelines for your AI use. These might include:
   - Types of tasks you'll use AI for
   - Boundaries you'll maintain
   - How you'll verify or evaluate AI-generated content
   - When you'll rely on purely human approaches

4. Share your draft guidelines with ChatGPT and ask for feedback: *"Here are my draft guidelines for using AI. Can you suggest any considerations I might have overlooked or ways to make these guidelines more practical?"*

5. Finalize your guidelines based on this feedback, keeping what resonates and discarding what doesn't fit your values and needs.

**Reflection Questions:**
- What did you learn about your own priorities through this exercise?
- Were there any suggestions from the AI that surprised you or made you reconsider your approach?
- How might these guidelines evolve as you gain more experience with AI tools?
- How do these guidelines reflect your understanding of Actual Intelligence as a human-AI partnership?
