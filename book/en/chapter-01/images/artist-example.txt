An older woman (representing "Elena" from the text) working on a watercolor painting of autumn leaves, while occasionally referring to AI suggestions displayed on a tablet nearby. The painting should be clearly her own creative work, with the tablet showing technical suggestions about color techniques. Her expression should show creative engagement and decision-making, illustrating that the AI provides technical advice but she maintains artistic control.
