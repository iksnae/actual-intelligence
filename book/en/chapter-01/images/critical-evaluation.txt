A person evaluating AI-generated content with a thoughtful, critical eye. Show someone reviewing AI output on a screen or printout, perhaps using a pen to mark up or highlight certain parts, with thought bubbles or annotations showing their evaluation process: "Is this accurate?", "Does this make sense for my situation?", "This part is useful but this needs revision." Their expression should show careful consideration rather than passive acceptance.
