A teacher (representing "Sarah" from the text) using AI to help plan curriculum while adding her own expertise. Show her at a desk with classroom materials, student information, and teaching resources alongside a computer displaying AI suggestions for her unit on "identity." She should be actively selecting, modifying, and combining the AI suggestions with her own ideas and knowledge of her students, perhaps by taking notes or creating an outline that merges both sources of input.
