A visual comparison of vague vs. specific prompts. Create a three-panel comparison showing: 1) A vague prompt ("Give me some advice") with a generic, broad response; 2) A somewhat specific prompt ("Give me some advice about learning new skills") with a more focused but still general response; and 3) A highly specific prompt (the detailed one about learning Spanish while commuting) with a tailored, practical response. The contrast in quality and usefulness should be immediately apparent, with the specific prompt yielding much more valuable results.
