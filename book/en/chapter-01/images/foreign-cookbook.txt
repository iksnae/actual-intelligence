A person following a recipe from a cookbook written in a language they don't understand. They should be in a kitchen, precisely following the steps in the foreign-language recipe (perhaps with confused or uncertain expressions), without understanding the meaning behind the instructions or being able to taste the ingredients. This illustrates how AI follows patterns without understanding meaning, just as someone might follow a recipe without understanding the language or culinary principles.
