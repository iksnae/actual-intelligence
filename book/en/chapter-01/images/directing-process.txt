A flowchart showing the process of directing AI effectively. Create a simple, clean flowchart with 7 steps: 1) Define your objective, 2) Provide context and constraints, 3) Start with specific questions/requests, 4) Evaluate responses critically, 5) Provide feedback and refinement, 6) Integrate multiple sources, and 7) Make final decisions. Each step should have a brief description and simple icon. Use arrows to show the flow and potential iteration between steps. The chart should be easy to follow and emphasize the human's role as director of the process.
