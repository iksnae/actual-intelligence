# Directing AI and Setting Realistic Expectations


Now that we understand the relationship between human intelligence and AI capabilities, let's focus on two critical elements that will make your AI experiences successful: how to effectively direct these tools and what you should realistically expect from them.


## The Director's Mindset


Remember our film director metaphor? Let's expand on what it means to be an effective director of AI tools.

Just as a film director doesn't simply tell actors "make a good scene" and hope for the best, you shouldn't approach AI with vague requests and passive acceptance of whatever it produces. The director's mindset involves several key practices:


### 1. Clarity of Purpose


"I used to start by asking ChatGPT vague questions and get frustrated with the generic answers," explains David, a small business consultant. "Now I always take a moment to get clear on exactly what I need before I even open the app."

Before engaging with AI, ask yourself:
- What specific problem am I trying to solve?
- What would a successful outcome look like?
- What constraints or requirements should I keep in mind?

This clarity helps you give more effective directions and evaluate the AI's responses more critically.


### 2. Specificity in Direction


Vague prompts lead to generic responses. The more specific your direction, the more useful the AI's assistance will be. Compare these approaches:

**Vague direction:** "Give me some marketing ideas."

**Specific direction:** "I run a local organic farm stand targeting health-conscious families. Suggest five low-budget marketing approaches that would help us emphasize our sustainable farming practices and community roots."

The specific direction provides context and constraints that help the AI generate relevant responses tailored to your needs.


### 3. Iterative Refinement


Working with AI is rarely a one-and-done process. Think of it as a conversation rather than a single question and answer.

"At first I'd just accept whatever the AI gave me," says Priya, a freelance writer. "Now I know that the magic happens in the back-and-forth. I'll say 'that's too formal' or 'can you add more examples about X' and the results get dramatically better."

Don't settle for the first response if it doesn't quite meet your needs. Instead, provide feedback and additional direction to guide the AI toward more useful outputs:

* "That's helpful, but could you make it simpler?"
* "I like the third idea best. Can you expand on that approach specifically?"
* "These examples are too technical. Can you rewrite them for someone with no background in this field?"


### 4. Critical Evaluation


Approach AI-generated content with a healthy skepticism. Ask yourself:
- Does this information seem accurate and reliable?
- Is this the right approach for my specific situation?
- Does this align with my values and objectives?

Remember that you are the ultimate judge of quality and appropriateness. The AI is there to assist you, not make final decisions.


## The Amplification Effect


When you combine human direction with AI capabilities, something remarkable happens: both are amplified beyond what either could achieve alone. This is the essence of Actual Intelligence.

- Your creativity is amplified by the AI's ability to quickly generate variations and alternatives
- Your knowledge is amplified by the AI's ability to provide information and perspectives you might not have considered
- Your productivity is amplified by the AI's ability to handle routine aspects of tasks, freeing you to focus on higher-level thinking


Sarah, a high school English teacher, experiences this amplification when planning her curriculum. She could spend hours searching for relevant reading materials, drafting discussion questions, and creating assignments. Instead, she directs ChatGPT with her specific educational goals and knowledge of her students:

![A teacher using AI to help plan curriculum while adding her own expertise](images/teacher-curriculum.png)

"I need to design a unit on 'identity' for my 10th grade English class. Many of my students are first-generation Americans who often discuss the challenges of navigating between cultures. Suggest contemporary short stories from diverse authors that explore identity formation, and for each story, outline potential discussion questions that connect to the immigrant experience."


With this direction, ChatGPT can quickly generate suggestions that Sarah then evaluates based on her professional judgment, knowledge of her specific students, and curriculum requirements. She might accept some suggestions, modify others, and reject those that don't fit her vision.


The result is a curriculum that reflects Sarah's expertise and understanding of her students, but was developed more efficiently and with a broader range of perspectives than she might have managed working entirely on her own. That's Actual Intelligence at work.


## Setting Realistic Expectations


One of the biggest challenges in working effectively with AI tools is setting realistic expectations. Media hype often presents AI as either magical thinking machines or imminent threats to humanity—neither of which accurately reflects the reality of current tools like ChatGPT.

"I was honestly intimidated by all the news about AI," admits Raj, a retired accountant. "I expected it to either be impossibly complex to use or creepily human-like. The reality was much more down-to-earth—helpful in some ways, limited in others."

Let's establish a balanced understanding of what these tools can and cannot do to help you use them more effectively.


### What AI Tools Can Do Well


#### Generate Human-Like Text


AI excels at producing various types of written content—from creative writing to technical explanations, from casual conversation to formal documents. It can adapt its tone, style, and complexity level based on your direction.

#### Process and Summarize Information


AI can take large amounts of information and distill it into summaries, key points, or structured formats that are easier to understand and use.


#### Brainstorm Ideas and Alternatives


AI can quickly generate multiple options, perspectives, or approaches to a problem, helping you explore possibilities you might not have considered on your own.


#### Draft and Edit Content


AI can create initial drafts of many types of content and help improve existing text by suggesting edits, reorganization, or alternative phrasing.


#### Explain Concepts at Various Levels


AI can explain complex topics in simpler terms or provide more detailed explanations of basic concepts, adapting to different knowledge levels and learning needs.


#### Simulate Conversations and Perspectives


AI can role-play different viewpoints or expertise areas, allowing you to explore how different people might approach a situation.


### What AI Tools Cannot Do Well


#### Verify Factual Accuracy


AI language models don't have the ability to independently verify facts. They can confidently present incorrect information (sometimes called "hallucinations") that sounds plausible but is actually wrong.

#### Provide Up-to-Date Information


AI training data has a cutoff date, after which the model has no knowledge of world events, new products, or recent developments unless specifically updated.


#### Access Your Personal Information


AI doesn't know who you are, your personal history, or your specific circumstances unless you explicitly share this information in your conversation.


#### Perform Actions in the Real World


AI language models can't directly access the internet, run programs, or interact with other systems unless specifically integrated with those capabilities.


#### Exercise True Judgment or Wisdom


AI can simulate advice or opinions, but lacks the lived experience, moral grounding, and contextual understanding needed for true wisdom or judgment.


#### Create Truly Original Ideas


While AI can recombine existing concepts in new ways, it doesn't generate truly novel ideas disconnected from its training data.


## Common Misconceptions


Let's address some frequent misconceptions about AI tools that can lead to unrealistic expectations:


### Misconception: "AI knows everything"


**Reality:** AI only knows what was in its training data, and that knowledge is neither comprehensive nor always accurate. It can present incorrect information with high confidence.


### Misconception: "AI is objective and unbiased"


**Reality:** AI reflects the biases present in its training data and those introduced by its creators. It does not have a neutral or objective viewpoint.


### Misconception: "AI understands what it's saying"


**Reality:** AI generates text without genuine comprehension. It doesn't understand concepts the way humans do—it predicts patterns in language without connecting them to real-world meaning.


### Misconception: "AI has opinions or beliefs"


**Reality:** AI simulates opinions based on patterns in its training data but doesn't actually hold beliefs or convictions.

### Misconception: "AI is always improving itself"


**Reality:** Most AI tools don't learn from your interactions unless specifically designed to do so. Your conversations typically don't make the AI smarter or more personalized to you over time.


## The Verification Principle


A helpful guideline when using AI tools is what we might call the "verification principle": the importance of an AI-generated response should be proportional to your verification efforts.


In other words:
- For low-stakes brainstorming or first drafts, you might accept AI output with minimal verification
- For moderate-stakes content, you should review AI suggestions carefully and make your own judgments
- For high-stakes decisions or factual claims, you should independently verify information through reliable sources

Michael, a hobby photographer researching camera equipment, applies this principle: "I use ChatGPT to get quick explanations of technical concepts and generate questions I should ask. But before spending $2,000 on a new camera, I always verify the specific model details on the manufacturer's website and read reviews from trusted photography sites."

This principle helps you use AI efficiently while managing the risks associated with its limitations.


## Taking Control of the Process


To fully embrace your role as the director of AI tools, consider this general approach:

1. **Define your objective** clearly before engaging with the AI

2. **Provide context and constraints** that help the AI understand your specific situation

3. **Start with specific questions or requests** rather than open-ended prompts

4. **Evaluate responses critically**, looking for both useful elements and potential issues

5. **Provide feedback and refinement** to guide the AI toward more helpful responses

6. **Integrate multiple sources**, not relying solely on AI-generated content

7. **Make the final decisions** based on your judgment, values, and knowledge

This approach puts you firmly in control of the process while still leveraging the AI's capabilities to enhance your thinking and productivity.
