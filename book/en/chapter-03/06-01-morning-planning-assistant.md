# Activity 1: Morning Planning Assistant
**Creating a Daily Planning Workflow**

## Objective
Develop a personalized morning planning routine using AI to organize your day more effectively while maintaining focus on your true priorities.

## What You'll Need
- Access to ChatGPT
- Your calendar or task list for the day
- 10-15 minutes of quiet time
- Paper and pen for notes (optional)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Initial Setup (One-Time Process)
1. Open ChatGPT and start a new conversation.
2. Create a template for your daily planning session with this prompt:
   ```
   I'd like to create a personalized morning planning routine to start my day with intention and organization. Please help me develop a template for a daily planning prompt that:
   
   1. Encourages reflection on my priorities and values
   2. Helps me organize my tasks effectively
   3. Addresses potential challenges proactively
   4. Maintains a balance between productivity and wellbeing
   5. Takes no more than 10 minutes to complete
   
   My typical day involves [briefly describe your general schedule and responsibilities]. My core values/priorities include [list 2-3 key priorities in your life].
   
   The template should be something I can reuse each morning with that day's specific information.
   ```

3. Review the suggested template and modify it to better fit your needs and preferences. Don't worry about getting it perfectâ€”you can refine it over time.

4. Save the final template in a place you can easily access each morning (notes app, document, or even as a screenshot).

### Step 2: Daily Planning Process
1. Each morning, open ChatGPT and paste your template, filling in the specific details for that day.

2. For example, your filled-in template might look something like:
   ```
   Good morning, ChatGPT. I'd like your help with planning my day intentionally.
   
   Today's date: [current date]
   
   My scheduled commitments today:
   - Team meeting (10:00-11:00)
   - Dentist appointment (2:30-3:30)
   - Need to pick up kids from school (3:45)
   
   Tasks I need to accomplish today:
   - Finish quarterly report
   - Call insurance company about claim
   - Order anniversary gift
   - Respond to emails from yesterday's project discussion
   - Schedule vet appointment for dog
   
   My energy level today feels: 7/10
   
   My top personal priority today is: Making time for a 30-minute walk
   
   Potential challenges today: The team meeting often runs long, which could make me rushed for the dentist appointment.
   
   Based on this information, please help me:
   1. Create a realistic schedule that incorporates my commitments and top 3 priority tasks
   2. Suggest which tasks might be better delegated or deferred
   3. Propose strategies for handling the potential time crunch between my meeting and appointment
   4. Remind me of how my daily tasks connect to my broader goals and values
   5. Suggest one small wellbeing practice I could incorporate today
   ```

3. Review ChatGPT's response, noting any particularly helpful suggestions or insights.

4. Take a moment to mentally commit to your plan for the day.

### Step 3: Refinement
After using your morning planning routine for at least 3-5 days, assess its effectiveness:

1. Open ChatGPT and use this prompt:
   ```
   I've been using our morning planning routine for [number] days now. Here's what I've observed:
   
   What's working well:
   - [list aspects that have been helpful]
   
   What could be improved:
   - [list any friction points or aspects that don't seem valuable]
   
   How I'd like to feel after my planning session:
   - [describe your ideal outcome from morning planning]
   
   Please suggest refinements to my daily planning template based on this feedback.
   ```

2. Update your template based on these suggestions and your own experience.

3. Continue the cycle of use, reflection, and refinement to develop a truly personalized planning system.

## Tips for Success
- **Consistency matters more than length**: A brief planning session you actually complete is better than an elaborate one you skip.
- **Focus on priorities, not just tasks**: Make sure your most important work gets attention, not just the urgent or easy items.
- **Build in flexibility**: Leave buffer time for unexpected events rather than scheduling every minute.
- **Connect daily actions to larger goals**: Regularly remind yourself how today's tasks connect to your broader purposes.
- **Include wellbeing elements**: Schedule breaks, meals, and at least one small enjoyable activity.

## Reflection Questions
After using your AI planning assistant for at least one week, consider these questions:

- How has having a structured planning routine affected your day?
- Which aspects of the AI-assisted planning process have been most valuable?
- Have you noticed any patterns in how you organize or prioritize your time?
- How might you further refine your system to better support your specific needs?
- What larger life patterns or challenges has this planning process revealed?

Remember that the ultimate goal isn't to create a perfect plan each day, but to develop a sustainable system that helps you align your daily actions with your deeper priorities and values.

**Robert, a business consultant, shares his experience**: "I was skeptical about spending time each morning with a planning ritual, thinking it would just be another task. But after two weeks, I realized it was actually saving me time throughout the day. Having clear priorities meant less decision fatigue, and the AI helped me notice patterns in how I was allocating my attention that I wouldn't have seen on my own."
