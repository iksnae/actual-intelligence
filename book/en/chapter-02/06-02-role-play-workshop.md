# Activity 2

## Role Play Workshop

**Objective:** Experiment with assigning different roles to ChatGPT for specific tasks.

**What You'll Need:**

- Access to ChatGPT
- Paper and pen for notes
- 20-25 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a topic you'd like advice or information about (e.g., starting a vegetable garden, improving public speaking skills, understanding basic economics).

2. Create prompts that assign ChatGPT each of these roles to address your topic:

   - A patient teacher explaining to a beginner
   - An experienced professional giving practical advice
   - A creative thinker generating unusual approaches
   - A methodical researcher providing evidence-based information
   - A mentor providing encouragement and motivation

3. Use each prompt with ChatGPT and take notes on how the responses differ.

4. Reflect on which role produced the most helpful response for your specific needs and why.

**Example Role Assignment:**

Topic: Learning to cook basic meals

**Teacher role:** `I want you to act as a cooking teacher for a complete beginner. Explain how to prepare a simple pasta dish with sauce, focusing on fundamental techniques and common mistakes to avoid. Use straightforward language and explain cooking terminology as you go.`

**Professional role:** `I want you to act as an experienced chef who specializes in efficient home cooking. Provide practical advice for preparing quick weeknight pasta dishes, including time-saving techniques, ingredient substitutions, and how to elevate basic recipes. Focus on methods used in professional kitchens that can be adapted for home use.`
