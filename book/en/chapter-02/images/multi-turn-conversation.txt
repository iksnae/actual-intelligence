Image Description: Multi-Turn Conversation Flow

This image illustrates an effective multi-turn conversation between a user and ChatGPT. The visualization shows:

A sequence of 5-6 message exchanges presented in the ChatGPT interface style, with user messages on one side and ChatGPT responses on the other

The conversation demonstrates a logical progression from an initial question about planning a small backyard garden, through multiple refinements, specific questions, and development of the plan

Call-out boxes or annotations highlight key conversational moves like:
- Clarifying ambiguous information
- Building on previous responses
- Asking for specific details
- Redirecting when needed
- Requesting format changes

Arrows connect related points between messages, showing how information builds across the conversation

The final exchange shows a much more developed and specific plan than what could have been achieved in a single prompt-response pair

This visualization demonstrates the iterative process of working with ChatGPT and how much more can be accomplished through thoughtful follow-up prompts than through a single exchange.
