# Activity 4

## Context Control

**Objective:** Practice managing and directing multi-turn conversations.

**What You'll Need:**

- Access to ChatGPT
- 20-30 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Choose a project or scenario that would benefit from a multi-step conversation (e.g., planning a special meal, organizing a small event, or developing a personal learning plan).

2. Start a conversation with a clear initial prompt about your project.

3. Through at least 5 follow-up exchanges, practice these context management techniques:

   - Ask for more detail on a specific aspect of the response
   - Redirect the conversation when it goes off-track
   - Reference information from earlier in the conversation
   - Request a modification to previous suggestions
   - Summarize progress and set direction for the next step

4. Reflect on how the conversation evolved and which techniques were most effective at maintaining productive context.

**Example Sequence:**

Project: Planning a weekend hiking trip

**Initial prompt:** `I'm planning a day hike this weekend with 2 friends. We're intermediate hikers looking for a trail within 2 hours of Portland, Oregon. We'd like something with good views that's between 5-8 miles round trip. Can you suggest some options?`

**Follow-up 1 (asking for detail):** `The Columbia River Gorge trails sound perfect. Can you provide more specific information about the Eagle Creek Trail? What's the elevation gain and are there any specific landmarks or viewpoints?`

**Follow-up 2 (referencing earlier information):** `Based on the elevation gain you mentioned, I think Eagle Creek might be too challenging for one member of our group. Of the other options you suggested earlier, which would have more moderate elevation changes?`
