## Basic Prompting Techniques

Now that you're familiar with the ChatGPT interface, let's explore how to craft effective prompts—the instructions you give to AI—to get the most useful responses.

### What Makes a Good Prompt?

A good prompt is like a well-formulated question or clear instruction. It provides enough information for ChatGPT to understand exactly what you're looking for. Let's look at the key elements of effective prompts:

**Clarity**: Be specific about what you want
**Context**: Provide relevant background information
**Constraints**: Set parameters or limitations
**Format**: Specify how you want the response structured

Let's see these elements in action with a before-and-after example:

**Weak prompt:**
"Help with my resume."

**Strong prompt:**
"I'm applying for entry-level marketing positions after graduating with a business degree. Could you help me improve the skills section of my resume? I want to highlight my social media experience, data analysis skills, and teamwork abilities in a concise, professional way using action verbs."

The stronger prompt provides clarity (improve skills section), context (recent graduate, marketing positions), constraints (concise, professional), and format guidance (action verbs).

### The Anatomy of Effective Prompts

Let's break down the structure of an effective prompt:

1. **Task specification**: Clearly state what you want ChatGPT to do
   - "Write," "Analyze," "Explain," "Summarize," etc.

2. **Relevant context**: Provide background information
   - Your experience level with the topic
   - Intended audience
   - Previous actions you've taken

3. **Parameters**: Set boundaries and requirements
   - Length (brief, detailed, 500 words, etc.)
   - Complexity level (beginner, expert, etc.)
   - Tone (formal, casual, enthusiastic, etc.)

4. **Output format**: Specify how you want the information presented
   - Bullet points
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Comparison table
   - Pros and cons list

Here's another example applying this structure:

**Task**: "Explain the concept of compound interest"
**Context**: "to a teenager who has never invested before"
**Parameters**: "Keep it simple and engaging, using real-life examples"
**Format**: "Start with a brief definition, then show a step-by-step calculation example"

Combined prompt: "Explain the concept of compound interest to a teenager who has never invested before. Keep it simple and engaging, using real-life examples. Start with a brief definition, then show a step-by-step calculation example."

### Common Prompt Types for Everyday Use

Here are some versatile prompt types you can adapt for various needs:

#### Information Requests

**Structure**: "Explain [topic] in [level of detail] terms, focusing on [specific aspects]."

**Example**: "Explain how solar panels work in simple terms, focusing on how they convert sunlight to electricity and their environmental benefits."

#### Creative Assistance

**Structure**: "Help me brainstorm [number] ideas for [creative project] that [criteria/constraints]."

**Example**: "Help me brainstorm 5 ideas for a children's birthday party that are indoor-friendly, engaging for 8-year-olds, and don't require expensive materials."

#### Analysis Requests

**Structure**: "Analyze [subject] from [specific perspectives], highlighting [key aspects]."

**Example**: "Analyze the pros and cons of remote work from both employee and employer perspectives, highlighting productivity impacts, cost considerations, and work-life balance."

#### Summarization Requests

**Structure**: "Summarize the key points of [content/topic] in [format], focusing on [specific elements]."

**Example**: "Summarize the key points of healthy eating habits in a bulleted list, focusing on dietary recommendations, meal timing, and common misconceptions."

#### Comparison Requests

**Structure**: "Compare [item A] and [item B] regarding [specific aspects] in a [format] format."

**Example**: "Compare traditional savings accounts and certificates of deposit regarding interest rates, accessibility, minimum deposits, and risks in a table format."

### Before and After: Transforming Weak Prompts

Let's practice identifying weak prompts and strengthening them:

**Weak**: "Tell me about climate change."

**Why it's weak**: Too broad, no specified format or depth, unclear what aspects are most relevant to the user.

**Improved**: "Explain the three most significant ways climate change is affecting agriculture globally. Include recent scientific findings and potential adaptation strategies farmers are using. Keep the explanation accessible to someone with basic science knowledge."

---

**Weak**: "How do I learn a language?"

**Why it's weak**: Vague, doesn't specify which language, the user's experience level, or learning goals.

**Improved**: "I want to learn conversational Spanish for an upcoming trip to Mexico in 3 months. I'm a complete beginner with about 30 minutes daily to practice. Please suggest a structured learning plan with specific resources and activities that prioritize practical travel vocabulary and basic conversation skills."

---

**Weak**: "Write an email."

**Why it's weak**: No information about purpose, recipient, tone, or content.

**Improved**: "Help me draft a polite email to my landlord requesting repairs for a leaking faucet that I first reported two weeks ago. The tone should be firm but respectful, and I want to emphasize that the leak is worsening and causing water damage to the cabinet below."

### Understanding AI Limitations in Prompting

Even with well-crafted prompts, it's important to understand ChatGPT's limitations:

- **Knowledge cutoff**: ChatGPT doesn't know about events after its training cutoff date
- **Factual accuracy**: It may sometimes present incorrect information confidently
- **Personal information**: It doesn't have access to your personal files, accounts, or browsing history unless you explicitly share them
- **Specialized expertise**: While knowledgeable in many areas, it isn't a replacement for professional advice in fields like medicine, law, or finance
- **Context window**: It can only recall information from the current conversation

Knowing these limitations helps set realistic expectations and develop strategies to work around them when needed.
