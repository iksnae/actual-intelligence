## Format Factory

**Objective:** Practice specifying different output formats for the same information.

**What You'll Need:**

- Access to ChatGPT
- 15-20 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Choose an informational topic you're interested in (e.g., the benefits of exercise, basic investing concepts, or tips for sustainable living).

2. Create prompts requesting the same core information in each of these formats:

   - A bulleted list of key points
   - A step-by-step guide
   - A table comparing different aspects
   - A FAQ (frequently asked questions) format
   - A narrative explanation with examples

3. Use each prompt with ChatGPT and observe how the same information is transformed by different format specifications.

4. Reflect on which format made the information most useful or accessible for your needs.

**Example Format Specification:**

Topic: Benefits of different types of exercise

**Bulleted list format:** `Provide the main benefits of different exercise types (cardio, strength training, flexibility, and balance) in a comprehensive bulleted list format. Organize by exercise category and keep each point concise and clear.`

**Comparison table format:** `Create a comparison table showing the benefits of different exercise types (cardio, strength training, flexibility, and balance). Include columns for physical benefits, mental/emotional benefits, recommended frequency, and beginner-friendly examples of each type.`
