## Email Assistant

**Objective:** Practice using ChatGPT to draft different types of professional and personal emails.

**What You'll Need:**

- Access to ChatGPT
- Scenarios for different types of emails
- 20-25 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. For each of the following email scenarios, craft a detailed prompt that specifies:

   - The purpose of the email
   - The relationship with the recipient
   - Key points that must be included
   - Desired tone and level of formality
   - Any constraints (length, style, etc.)

2. Email scenarios to address:

   - A request for information from a business or organization
   - A professional networking message to someone you briefly met
   - A complaint about a product or service that seeks resolution
   - A message declining an invitation or opportunity
   - A thank-you note for significant help or a gift

3. For at least one email, practice the refinement process by requesting specific changes to the initial draft.

4. Reflect on which elements of your prompts were most important for getting appropriate, ready-to-use email drafts.

**Example Email Prompt:**

**Scenario:** Requesting a letter of recommendation

**Prompt:**

`Help me draft an email to my former professor, Dr. Martinez, requesting a letter of recommendation for a graduate school application. We had a positive relationship - I took two of her courses in environmental science and earned A's in both. She also supervised my senior research project last year. The application is due in 3 weeks, and I need the letter submitted online by then. I want the tone to be respectful and professional but not overly formal since we worked closely together. The email should be concise (no more than 3 paragraphs), mention specific accomplishments she observed that would strengthen my application, and offer to provide any additional information she might need.`
