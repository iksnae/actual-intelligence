### Activity 1: Prompt Makeover

**Objective:** Transform vague prompts into effective, detailed instructions.

**What You'll Need:**

- Access to ChatGPT
- 15-20 minutes

**Instructions:**

1. Look at each of the following basic prompts:

   - `Help me write a resume.`
   - `Tell me about healthy eating.`
   - `How do I fix my garden?`
   - `Give me ideas for my presentation.`
   - `Help with my homework.`

2. For each basic prompt, develop an improved version by adding:

   - Specific context about your situation
   - Clear parameters or constraints
   - Format specifications where appropriate
   - Any relevant background information

3. Try both the basic and improved versions with ChatGPT and compare the results.

4. Reflect on the differences in the responses. Which elements of your improved prompts had the biggest impact on the quality and relevance of the results?

**Example Makeover:**

**Original:** `Help me write a resume.`

**Improved:** `I need help creating a resume for entry-level marketing positions. I recently graduated with a degree in communications and have two summers of internship experience in social media management. Could you create a one-page resume template that highlights transferable skills from my academic projects and internships, uses a clean professional format, and includes sections for education, experience, skills, and a brief professional summary?`
