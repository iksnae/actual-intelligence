# Spanish Build Fix

This document explains the issue with the Spanish book build and the fix implemented in this branch.

## The Issue

When building the book with the `--all-languages` flag, only the English version was being successfully built and published. The Spanish version would not get built properly, resulting in missing PDF and EPUB files, despite the Spanish content being properly structured in the repository.

The issue appears to be that while the Spanish language is correctly included in the languages array to be built, the Spanish build process was not being fully executed or completing successfully.

## The Fix

This branch implements a solution that explicitly runs the Spanish build process after the main build script, ensuring that all Spanish content is properly processed. The fix consists of:

1. **A dedicated fix script** (`tools/scripts/fix-spanish-build.sh`) that:
   - Ensures all Spanish output directories exist
   - Copies the Spanish cover image to the correct location
   - Explicitly runs the Spanish build process for markdown, PDF, and EPUB formats
   - Verifies the output files exist and have reasonable file sizes

2. **Updated GitHub workflow** (`.github/workflows/build-book.yml`) that:
   - Calls the Spanish build fix script after the main build process
   - Maintains all the existing functionality of the build process

## Testing the Fix

To test this fix:

1. Run the build process with the Spanish fix script:
   ```
   ./build.sh --all-languages
   chmod +x tools/scripts/fix-spanish-build.sh
   ./tools/scripts/fix-spanish-build.sh
   ```

2. Verify that both English and Spanish output files are properly generated:
   ```
   ls -la build/*.pdf build/*.epub
   ```

## Expected Results

After implementing this fix, the build process should generate:

- English PDF: `build/actual-intelligence.pdf`
- English EPUB: `build/actual-intelligence.epub`
- Spanish PDF: `build/inteligencia-real.pdf`
- Spanish EPUB: `build/inteligencia-real.epub`

These files will then be correctly included in the release artifacts and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Long-term Solution

While this fix addresses the immediate issue, a more comprehensive solution might involve a deeper review of the build process to understand why the Spanish build was not completing in the main build script. However, this approach provides a reliable solution without significant changes to the existing build infrastructure.
