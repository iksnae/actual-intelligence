<h1 id="chapter-1-actual-intelligence---the-human-side-of-ai">Chapter 1:
Actual Intelligence - The Human Side of AI</h1>
<p>Welcome to the first chapter of “Actual Intelligence,” where we’ll
establish the fundamental principle that will guide our entire journey:
AI is merely a tool, and the real intelligence—the “Actual
Intelligence”—comes from you, the human using it.</p>
<p>In a world increasingly filled with headlines about artificial
intelligence, it’s easy to feel intimidated or even threatened by these
seemingly magical technologies. But the truth is both simpler and more
empowering: these tools are powerful extensions of human capabilities,
not replacements for human intelligence.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll explore the relationship between human
intelligence and AI tools like ChatGPT, helping you understand both in
non-technical terms. We’ll clarify what these tools can and cannot do,
dispel common misconceptions, and establish a framework for thinking
about the human-AI partnership that puts you firmly in control.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we’ll introduce practical activities that help you
take the driver’s seat in your AI interactions from day one. These
hands-on exercises will demonstrate how your direction, judgment, and
creativity remain essential when working with AI tools.</p>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a clear understanding of what
we mean by “Actual Intelligence” and why your role as the human director
of AI tools is so crucial to getting valuable results. You’ll also have
experienced firsthand how the quality of your direction directly impacts
the usefulness of AI outputs.</p>
<p>Let’s begin our journey toward becoming confident, effective
directors of these powerful tools, rather than passive consumers of
whatever they produce.</p>
<hr />
<div style="page-break-after: always;">

<h1 id="what-is-actual-intelligence-the-human-ai-partnership">What is
“Actual Intelligence”? (The Human-AI Partnership)</h1>
<p>In a world increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence, we
often find ourselves wondering about our place alongside these powerful
tools. The term “Actual Intelligence” might seem like yet another AI
buzzword, but it represents something far more important: the unique and
irreplaceable human intelligence that gives AI its purpose and
direction.</p>
<p><strong>Actual Intelligence</strong> is what happens when human
wisdom, creativity, and judgment combine with AI capabilities to solve
real problems. It’s not about the tool—it’s about how you use it.</p>
<p>Imagine a master carpenter with a collection of sophisticated power
tools. The tools themselves, regardless of how advanced they are, cannot
decide what to build or why it matters. They cannot determine if a table
should be round or rectangular based on a family’s specific needs. They
cannot feel satisfaction when the finished piece brings joy to its new
owners. This decision-making, purpose-finding, and meaning-creating
ability is the domain of human intelligence—the actual intelligence that
drives the entire process.</p>
<p>In the same way, AI tools like ChatGPT are incredibly sophisticated
instruments that can process language, generate content, and help with
various tasks—but they fundamentally lack the human spark that gives
those tasks meaning and direction.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The Human-AI Partnership
Model</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="the-partnership-model">The Partnership Model</h2>
<p>Rather than thinking of AI as a replacement for human thinking, we
invite you to consider a different model: the human-AI partnership. In
this relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You</strong> provide the goals, values, creativity, and
judgment</li>
<li><strong>AI</strong> provides computational power, information
access, and task assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>This partnership model places you—the human—firmly in the driver’s
seat. You are not just a passive user of AI but its director and
purpose-giver. You are the intelligence that matters most.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, we’ll refer to this partnership as “Actual
Intelligence”—the powerful combination of human wisdom and AI
capabilities working together to achieve goals that matter to you.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-distinction-matters">Why This Distinction Matters</h2>
<p>Understanding this relationship is not just a philosophical
exercise—it has practical implications for how effectively you’ll use AI
tools:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It empowers you to take an active role rather than a passive
one</li>
<li>It helps you set realistic expectations about what AI can and cannot
do</li>
<li>It encourages you to develop the skills that remain uniquely
human</li>
<li>It helps you maintain ownership of your work and ideas</li>
</ol>
<p>As AI tools become increasingly embedded in our daily lives, those
who understand how to direct them effectively—those who exercise their
Actual Intelligence—will have an undeniable advantage.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-element">The Human Element</h2>
<p>Consider Lisa, a middle school science teacher preparing lessons on
climate change. She could simply ask ChatGPT to “create a climate change
lesson for 7th graders” and use whatever it generates. That would be
using AI as a replacement for her own thinking.</p>
<p>Instead, Lisa applies her Actual Intelligence. She knows her specific
students—their knowledge levels, interests, and the local environmental
issues they see every day. She understands which concepts they’ve
struggled with in past lessons. She has educational goals beyond just
conveying information—she wants to inspire curiosity and environmental
stewardship.</p>
<p>With this human context that no AI could fully grasp, Lisa directs
ChatGPT to create specific components that fit her vision: “Help me
create an interactive demonstration that shows how greenhouse gases
work, suitable for 7th graders who have already learned about the water
cycle but struggle with abstract concepts.”</p>
<p>The resulting lesson is far more effective because it combines Lisa’s
deep understanding of her students with the AI’s ability to generate
creative teaching ideas. That’s Actual Intelligence at work—the human
remains central to the process while leveraging AI as a powerful
tool.</p>
<p>In the chapters ahead, we’ll show you how to develop this partnership
approach with AI tools, starting with the fundamentals and building to
more advanced applications. But first, let’s further explore the
relationship between AI tools and human intelligence to set a solid
foundation for our journey.</p>
<hr />
<div style="page-break-after: always;">

<h1
id="ai-tools-vs.-human-intelligence-understanding-the-relationship">AI
Tools vs. Human Intelligence: Understanding the Relationship</h1>
<p>To use AI tools effectively, it’s helpful to understand both their
remarkable capabilities and their fundamental limitations. Let’s explore
what makes human intelligence different from artificial intelligence and
why that difference creates such a powerful partnership when the two
work together.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-human-intelligence-unique">What Makes Human
Intelligence Unique</h2>
<p>Human intelligence has several qualities that current AI systems
simply don’t possess, despite their impressive capabilities:</p>
<h3 id="purpose-and-meaning">Purpose and Meaning</h3>
<p>Humans naturally seek and create meaning. We ask “why” questions, set
goals based on our values, and derive satisfaction from achieving things
that matter to us. We care about the purpose behind an activity, not
just its execution.</p>
<p>AI systems, by contrast, have no intrinsic purposes or desires. They
don’t “want” anything—they simply process inputs and generate outputs
according to their programming. Any sense of purpose must come from the
humans using them.</p>
<h3 id="contextual-understanding">Contextual Understanding</h3>
<p>Humans possess a rich understanding of the world built through lived
experience. We understand the physical reality of objects, the emotional
reality of relationships, and the practical reality of how things work
in daily life—not just as abstract concepts but as deeply felt, personal
knowledge.</p>
<p>AI systems like ChatGPT have been trained on vast amounts of text
that describe the world, but they haven’t experienced it directly. They
can simulate understanding but lack the grounding that comes from living
in the physical world and navigating human society.</p>
<h3 id="creativity-and-intuition">Creativity and Intuition</h3>
<p>Human creativity often involves making unexpected connections, being
inspired by seemingly unrelated ideas, or having sudden insights that
can’t be fully explained. Our intuition allows us to make judgment calls
based on subtle cues and years of experience.</p>
<p>While AI can recombine existing ideas in impressive ways, it doesn’t
have the spark of genuine inspiration or the intuitive sense that allows
humans to make leaps beyond what’s explicitly known.</p>
<h3 id="ethical-judgment">Ethical Judgment</h3>
<p>Humans can make complex ethical judgments, weighing values that
sometimes conflict, considering the welfare of others, and making
decisions in ambiguous situations. We can assess not just what is
possible but what is right or appropriate.</p>
<p>AI systems can be programmed with rules and guidelines, but they
don’t truly understand ethics or possess values of their own. They can
simulate ethical reasoning based on patterns in their training data, but
the ultimate ethical judgment must come from humans.</p>
<h2 id="what-ai-tools-do-well">What AI Tools Do Well</h2>
<p>While AI lacks these uniquely human capacities, it excels in other
areas that complement human intelligence beautifully:</p>
<h3 id="information-processing">Information Processing</h3>
<p>AI can process and synthesize enormous amounts of information far
beyond what a human could handle. It can quickly generate summaries,
find patterns, and make connections across vast datasets.</p>
<h3 id="consistent-output">Consistent Output</h3>
<p>AI doesn’t get tired, distracted, or emotional. It can produce
consistent results without the natural fluctuations in performance that
humans experience.</p>
<h3 id="rapid-idea-generation">Rapid Idea Generation</h3>
<p>AI can quickly produce multiple options, drafts, or approaches to a
problem, providing humans with a broader range of possibilities to
consider than they might generate alone.</p>
<h3 id="learning-from-patterns">Learning from Patterns</h3>
<p>AI systems excel at identifying patterns in data and can help humans
recognize trends or connections they might otherwise miss.</p>
<h2 id="the-complementary-relationship">The Complementary
Relationship</h2>
<p>These differences between human and artificial intelligence aren’t a
weakness—they’re the foundation of a powerful partnership. Think of AI
as extending specific aspects of your cognitive abilities, similar to
how:</p>
<ul>
<li>A telescope extends your vision to see distant stars</li>
<li>A calculator extends your ability to perform mathematical
operations</li>
<li>A book extends your memory by storing information</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these tools enhances specific human capabilities without
replacing the human. The telescope doesn’t decide where to look—you do.
The calculator doesn’t determine which problem needs solving—you do. The
book doesn’t interpret the meaning of its information—you do.</p>
<p>In the same way, AI extends certain cognitive capabilities without
replacing the uniquely human elements of intelligence.</p>
<h2 id="the-director-and-the-assistant">The Director and the
Assistant</h2>
<p>A helpful metaphor for understanding this relationship is to think of
yourself as a film director and AI as your assistant.</p>
<p>As the director, you: - Determine the vision and purpose of the
project - Make creative and ethical decisions - Evaluate quality based
on your taste and judgment - Take ultimate responsibility for the final
product</p>
<p>The AI assistant: - Helps execute specific tasks - Offers options
based on your direction - Provides information and suggestions - Works
tirelessly on the details you specify</p>
<p>Without the director, the assistant would have no purpose or
direction. Without the assistant, the director would have to handle
every small detail alone.</p>
<p>Together, they can create something better than either could produce
independently. This is the essence of Actual Intelligence—the powerful
combination of human direction and AI assistance.</p>
<h2 id="bringing-it-together">Bringing It Together</h2>
<p>Consider Marcus, a small business owner planning to open a second
location for his bakery. He could simply ask AI, “Where should I open my
second bakery location?” But the AI has no knowledge of his specific
business, customer base, financial situation, or personal goals.</p>
<p>Instead, Marcus applies his Actual Intelligence. He knows his
business intimately—what makes his current location successful, what his
customers value most, and his long-term vision. He also understands his
financial constraints and how much risk he’s willing to take.</p>
<p>Marcus directs the AI with specific questions that leverage its
strengths while applying his unique knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What demographic data should I analyze when selecting a new bakery
location?”</li>
<li>“Help me create a checklist for evaluating potential retail spaces
for a bakery.”</li>
<li>“What are typical challenges bakeries face when opening a second
location?”</li>
</ul>
<p>The AI provides valuable information and frameworks, but Marcus makes
the final decision based on factors only he can fully understand—his
appetite for risk, his intuition about different neighborhoods, and his
vision for his brand.</p>
<p>In the coming chapters, we’ll show you how to develop this
director-assistant relationship with AI, starting with understanding how
these tools actually work (in non-technical terms) and then building
practical skills for directing them effectively.</p>
<hr />
<div style="page-break-after: always;">

</div>
<h1
id="how-modern-ai-tools-work-simplified-for-non-technical-readers">How
Modern AI Tools Work (Simplified for Non-Technical Readers)</h1>
<p>To effectively direct AI tools, you don’t need to understand all the
technical details of how they work—just as you don’t need to know
exactly how a car engine functions to drive effectively. However, having
a basic conceptual understanding will help you develop realistic
expectations and use these tools more skillfully.</p>
<p>Let’s explore how modern AI tools like ChatGPT work, using simple
analogies that highlight both their capabilities and limitations.</p>
<h2 id="the-pattern-completion-machine">The Pattern Completion
Machine</h2>
<p>At its core, an AI like ChatGPT is a sophisticated pattern completion
machine. It has been trained on enormous amounts of text from books,
articles, websites, and other sources. During this training, it learned
to recognize patterns in how words and ideas typically follow one
another.</p>
<p>When you give it a prompt, it looks for patterns similar to ones it
has seen before and generates a response that continues those patterns
in a way that seems sensible.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/pattern-matcher.svg"
alt="AI as a Pattern Completion Machine" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">AI as a Pattern Completion
Machine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Imagine ChatGPT as a musician who has listened to thousands of songs
but doesn’t actually understand music theory. When you hum a few notes,
the musician can continue the melody based on similar patterns they’ve
heard before. They’re not composing something truly original—they’re
drawing on all the music they’ve absorbed to continue the pattern you
started.</p>
<h2 id="the-echo-chamber-of-human-knowledge">The Echo Chamber of Human
Knowledge</h2>
<p>Another helpful way to think about these AI tools is as an echo
chamber of human knowledge. They can only reflect back information and
patterns that already exist in the data they were trained on.</p>
<p>If you ask ChatGPT about the French Revolution, it can provide
information because many human writers have written about this topic,
and those writings were part of its training data. But if you ask about
a completely fictional historical event that no one has written about,
it can’t provide accurate information because that pattern doesn’t exist
in its training data.</p>
<p>This means AI tools: - Can reflect existing human knowledge and
writing patterns - Cannot generate truly novel discoveries or insights
that aren’t derived from existing knowledge - May confidently present
information that seems plausible but is actually incorrect</p>
<h2 id="text-prediction-not-understanding">Text Prediction, Not
Understanding</h2>
<p>Despite its impressive ability to generate human-like text, ChatGPT
doesn’t actually “understand” the meaning of words the way humans do. It
predicts which words are likely to follow each other based on
statistical patterns, not based on connecting those words to real-world
experiences or deeper concepts.</p>
<p>Think of it like someone who has memorized a cookbook in a foreign
language without understanding what the words mean. They might be able
to recite recipes perfectly and even make reasonable substitutions based
on patterns they’ve observed, but they’ve never tasted the food, felt
the texture of the ingredients, or understood why certain techniques are
used.</p>
<p>This limitation explains why AI often struggles with: - Common sense
reasoning - Understanding the physical world - Grasping cause and effect
- Distinguishing between plausible-sounding nonsense and actual
truth</p>
<h2 id="the-probability-generator">The Probability Generator</h2>
<p>When ChatGPT generates text, it’s essentially making a series of word
choices based on probability. For each position in a sentence, it
calculates which word is most likely to come next, given the preceding
words and the overall context.</p>
<p>Imagine a game where you start a sentence, and someone has to guess
what word comes next:</p>
<p>“The chef put the cake in the…”</p>
<p>Most people would guess “oven” because that’s the most probable word
to follow in this context. AI systems do something similar, but with a
much more sophisticated understanding of language patterns and a much
larger vocabulary of possible words to choose from.</p>
<p>This probabilistic approach means that: - ChatGPT doesn’t have a
fixed set of responses—it generates new text each time - Responses can
vary even to identical prompts - The AI doesn’t “decide” what to say
based on reasoning—it selects words based on probability</p>
<h2 id="limitations-by-design">Limitations by Design</h2>
<p>Modern AI tools also have intentional limitations built into them by
their creators. Companies like OpenAI have implemented safety measures
that prevent their AI from generating certain types of harmful content,
even if the patterns for that content exist in the training data.</p>
<p>These guardrails are an important part of responsible AI development,
but they also mean that the AI is not simply a neutral
pattern-matcher—it has been designed to avoid certain topics and favor
others.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-you">What This Means for You</h2>
<p>Understanding these basics about how AI works helps explain both its
impressive capabilities and its surprising limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>It can generate human-like text</strong> because it has
learned patterns from vast amounts of human writing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It can provide information on many topics</strong>
because it has been trained on diverse texts</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It struggles with factual accuracy</strong> because it’s
predicting plausible text, not verifying truth</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It can’t truly reason or understand</strong> because it’s
matching patterns, not comprehending meaning</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It doesn’t have experiences or goals</strong> because
it’s a text prediction system, not a conscious entity</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These characteristics make AI tools incredibly useful for certain
tasks but also highlight why human direction and judgment—your Actual
Intelligence—remains essential.</p>
<h2 id="the-assistant-not-the-expert">The Assistant, Not the Expert</h2>
<p>Given these limitations, it’s helpful to think of AI tools as
assistants rather than experts or authorities. They can help you
brainstorm, draft content, summarize information, and explore ideas, but
you should always apply your own judgment to their output.</p>
<p>Remember Jake, who’s planning a family vacation to Japan. If he
simply asks ChatGPT “Plan my perfect Japan trip” and follows whatever
itinerary it generates, he might end up with a generic tourist
experience that doesn’t match his family’s interests or visit
attractions that are closed for renovation.</p>
<p>Instead, Jake uses his understanding of AI limitations to direct the
tool more effectively. He knows that: - The AI’s information might be
outdated - It doesn’t know his family’s specific preferences - It can’t
verify if suggested accommodations are actually available</p>
<p>So he uses AI as an assistant for specific tasks where pattern
matching is helpful—generating ideas for kid-friendly activities in
Tokyo, suggesting phrasing for basic Japanese phrases, or creating a
packing checklist—while handling the critical judgment calls himself and
verifying key information through other sources.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll explore how to take control of this
human-AI partnership to get the most value from these powerful but
limited tools.</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;">

</div>
<h1 id="the-power-of-human-direction-you-are-the-intelligence">The Power
of Human Direction: You Are the Intelligence</h1>
<p>Now that we understand the relationship between AI tools and human
intelligence, let’s focus on the most critical element of this
partnership: your role as the director. The true power of AI tools
emerges only when guided by human intelligence, purpose, and
judgment—and developing these direction skills is what this book is all
about.</p>
<h2 id="the-directors-mindset">The Director’s Mindset</h2>
<p>When working with AI tools like ChatGPT, adopting a “director’s
mindset” can transform your results. This means approaching the
interaction with clear intention, maintaining control of the process,
and taking responsibility for the outcome.</p>
<p>Just as a film director doesn’t simply tell actors “make a good
scene” and hope for the best, you shouldn’t approach AI with vague
requests and passive acceptance of whatever it produces. The director’s
mindset involves:</p>
<h3 id="clarity-of-purpose">1. Clarity of Purpose</h3>
<p>Before engaging with AI, get clear on what you’re trying to
accomplish. Ask yourself: - What specific problem am I trying to solve?
- What would a successful outcome look like? - What constraints or
requirements should I keep in mind?</p>
<p>This clarity helps you give more effective directions and evaluate
the AI’s responses more critically.</p>
<h3 id="specificity-in-direction">2. Specificity in Direction</h3>
<p>Vague prompts lead to generic responses. The more specific your
direction, the more useful the AI’s assistance will be. Compare these
approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Vague direction:</strong> “Give me some marketing ideas.”</p>
<p><strong>Specific direction:</strong> “I run a local organic farm
stand targeting health-conscious families. Suggest five low-budget
marketing approaches that would help us emphasize our sustainable
farming practices and community roots.”</p>
<p>The specific direction is much more likely to yield useful results
because it provides context and constraints that help the AI generate
relevant responses.</p>
<h3 id="iterative-refinement">3. Iterative Refinement</h3>
<p>Working with AI is rarely a one-and-done process. The best results
often come through multiple rounds of direction, feedback, and
refinement—just as a director might work with actors through multiple
takes of a scene.</p>
<p>Don’t settle for the first response if it doesn’t quite meet your
needs. Instead, provide feedback and additional direction to guide the
AI toward more useful outputs.</p>
<h3 id="critical-evaluation">4. Critical Evaluation</h3>
<p>Approach AI-generated content with a healthy skepticism. Ask
yourself: - Does this information seem accurate and reliable? - Is this
the right approach for my specific situation? - Does this align with my
values and objectives?</p>
<p>Remember that you are the ultimate judge of quality and
appropriateness. The AI is there to assist you, not make final
decisions.</p>
<h2 id="your-unique-contributions">Your Unique Contributions</h2>
<p>As the human director of AI tools, you bring several irreplaceable
elements to the partnership:</p>
<h3 id="personal-knowledge-and-context">Personal Knowledge and
Context</h3>
<p>You have specific knowledge about your situation that no AI could
possibly know—your personal history, the nuances of your relationships,
the specific culture of your workplace, your private goals and
constraints. This contextual knowledge is essential for adapting generic
AI suggestions to your unique circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="values-and-priorities">Values and Priorities</h3>
<p>You know what matters to you, which trade-offs you’re willing to
make, and where your boundaries lie. These values and priorities should
guide how you evaluate and use AI-generated content.</p>
<h3 id="creative-vision">Creative Vision</h3>
<p>You have the ability to envision possibilities beyond what currently
exists—to imagine a better future and work toward it. This creative
vision gives purpose and direction to your use of AI tools.</p>
<h3 id="real-world-validation">Real-World Validation</h3>
<p>You can test ideas in the real world, gather feedback, and observe
results. This ability to validate and refine based on real outcomes is
something AI cannot do on its own.</p>
<h2 id="the-amplification-effect">The Amplification Effect</h2>
<p>When you combine human direction with AI capabilities, something
remarkable happens: both are amplified beyond what either could achieve
alone. This is the essence of Actual Intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your creativity is amplified by the AI’s ability to quickly generate
variations and alternatives</li>
<li>Your knowledge is amplified by the AI’s ability to provide
information and perspectives you might not have considered</li>
<li>Your productivity is amplified by the AI’s ability to handle routine
aspects of tasks, freeing you to focus on higher-level thinking</li>
</ul>
<p>Sarah, a high school English teacher, experiences this amplification
when planning her curriculum. She could spend hours searching for
relevant reading materials, drafting discussion questions, and creating
assignments. Instead, she directs ChatGPT with her specific educational
goals and knowledge of her students:</p>
<p>“I need to design a unit on ‘identity’ for my 10th grade English
class. Many of my students are first-generation Americans who often
discuss the challenges of navigating between cultures. Suggest
contemporary short stories from diverse authors that explore identity
formation, and for each story, outline potential discussion questions
that connect to the immigrant experience.”</p>
<p>With this direction, ChatGPT can quickly generate suggestions that
Sarah then evaluates based on her professional judgment, knowledge of
her specific students, and curriculum requirements. She might accept
some suggestions, modify others, and reject those that don’t fit her
vision.</p>
<p>The result is a curriculum that reflects Sarah’s expertise and
understanding of her students, but was developed more efficiently and
with a broader range of perspectives than she might have managed working
entirely on her own. That’s Actual Intelligence at work.</p>
<h2 id="taking-control-of-the-process">Taking Control of the
Process</h2>
<p>To fully embrace your role as the director of AI tools, consider this
general approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Define your objective</strong> clearly before engaging
with the AI</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide context and constraints</strong> that help the AI
understand your specific situation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start with specific questions or requests</strong> rather
than open-ended prompts</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate responses critically</strong>, looking for both
useful elements and potential issues</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide feedback and refinement</strong> to guide the AI
toward more helpful responses</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate multiple sources</strong>, not relying solely
on AI-generated content</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make the final decisions</strong> based on your judgment,
values, and knowledge</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This approach puts you firmly in control of the process while still
leveraging the AI’s capabilities to enhance your thinking and
productivity.</p>
<p>In the coming chapters, we’ll develop these direction skills further,
providing specific techniques and examples for various contexts. But
first, let’s address an important question: what exactly can you expect
from these AI tools, and what limitations should you keep in mind?</p>
<hr />
<div style="page-break-after: always;">

</div>
<h1
id="setting-realistic-expectations-what-ai-can-and-cannot-do">Setting
Realistic Expectations: What AI Can and Cannot Do</h1>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in working effectively with AI tools is
setting realistic expectations. Media hype often presents AI as either
magical thinking machines or imminent threats to humanity—neither of
which accurately reflects the reality of current tools like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Let’s establish a balanced understanding of what these tools can and
cannot do to help you use them more effectively.</p>
<h2 id="what-ai-tools-can-do-well">What AI Tools Can Do Well</h2>
<h3 id="generate-human-like-text">Generate Human-Like Text</h3>
<p>AI excels at producing various types of written content—from creative
writing to technical explanations, from casual conversation to formal
documents. It can adapt its tone, style, and complexity level based on
your direction.</p>
<h3 id="process-and-summarize-information">Process and Summarize
Information</h3>
<p>AI can take large amounts of information and distill it into
summaries, key points, or structured formats that are easier to
understand and use.</p>
<h3 id="brainstorm-ideas-and-alternatives">Brainstorm Ideas and
Alternatives</h3>
<p>AI can quickly generate multiple options, perspectives, or approaches
to a problem, helping you explore possibilities you might not have
considered on your own.</p>
<h3 id="draft-and-edit-content">Draft and Edit Content</h3>
<p>AI can create initial drafts of many types of content and help
improve existing text by suggesting edits, reorganization, or
alternative phrasing.</p>
<h3 id="explain-concepts-at-various-levels">Explain Concepts at Various
Levels</h3>
<p>AI can explain complex topics in simpler terms or provide more
detailed explanations of basic concepts, adapting to different knowledge
levels and learning needs.</p>
<h3 id="simulate-conversations-and-perspectives">Simulate Conversations
and Perspectives</h3>
<p>AI can role-play different viewpoints or expertise areas, allowing
you to explore how different people might approach a situation.</p>
<h2 id="what-ai-tools-cannot-do-well">What AI Tools Cannot Do Well</h2>
<h3 id="verify-factual-accuracy">Verify Factual Accuracy</h3>
<p>AI language models don’t have the ability to independently verify
facts. They can confidently present incorrect information (sometimes
called “hallucinations”) that sounds plausible but is actually
wrong.</p>
<h3 id="provide-up-to-date-information">Provide Up-to-Date
Information</h3>
<p>AI training data has a cutoff date, after which the model has no
knowledge of world events, new products, or recent developments unless
specifically updated.</p>
<h3 id="access-your-personal-information">Access Your Personal
Information</h3>
<p>AI doesn’t know who you are, your personal history, or your specific
circumstances unless you explicitly share this information in your
conversation.</p>
<h3 id="perform-actions-in-the-real-world">Perform Actions in the Real
World</h3>
<p>AI language models can’t directly access the internet, run programs,
or interact with other systems unless specifically integrated with those
capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-true-judgment-or-wisdom">Exercise True Judgment or
Wisdom</h3>
<p>AI can simulate advice or opinions, but lacks the lived experience,
moral grounding, and contextual understanding needed for true wisdom or
judgment.</p>
<h3 id="create-truly-original-ideas">Create Truly Original Ideas</h3>
<p>While AI can recombine existing concepts in new ways, it doesn’t
generate truly novel ideas disconnected from its training data.</p>
<h2 id="common-misconceptions">Common Misconceptions</h2>
<p>Let’s address some frequent misconceptions about AI tools that can
lead to unrealistic expectations:</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-knows-everything">Misconception: “AI knows
everything”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI only knows what was in its training
data, and that knowledge is neither comprehensive nor always accurate.
It can present incorrect information with high confidence.</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-is-objective-and-unbiased">Misconception: “AI
is objective and unbiased”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI reflects the biases present in its
training data and those introduced by its creators. It does not have a
neutral or objective viewpoint.</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-understands-what-its-saying">Misconception: “AI
understands what it’s saying”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI generates text without genuine
comprehension. It doesn’t understand concepts the way humans do—it
predicts patterns in language without connecting them to real-world
meaning.</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-has-opinions-or-beliefs">Misconception: “AI has
opinions or beliefs”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI simulates opinions based on patterns in
its training data but doesn’t actually hold beliefs or convictions.</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-is-always-improving-itself">Misconception: “AI
is always improving itself”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Most AI tools don’t learn from your
interactions unless specifically designed to do so. Your conversations
typically don’t make the AI smarter or more personalized to you over
time.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-sweet-spot">Finding the Sweet Spot</h2>
<p>Understanding these capabilities and limitations helps you find the
“sweet spot” for using AI tools effectively—the zone where you leverage
their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses with your human
judgment.</p>
<p>Consider Maria, who’s starting a new fitness routine. She might use
ChatGPT to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate workout options suitable for beginners (leveraging AI’s
ability to create structured content)</li>
<li>Explain unfamiliar exercise terminology (using AI’s explanatory
capabilities)</li>
<li>Brainstorm strategies for staying motivated (tapping into AI’s idea
generation)</li>
</ul>
<p>But she would not: - Rely on AI for personalized medical advice
(recognizing AI’s lack of medical expertise and knowledge of her
specific health conditions) - Assume exercise information is up-to-date
with the latest research (knowing AI has a knowledge cutoff date) - Take
AI’s suggestions as the final word on what’s right for her body
(applying her own judgment and listening to her physical responses)</p>
<p>This balanced approach allows Maria to benefit from AI assistance
while maintaining appropriate caution about its limitations.</p>
<h2 id="the-verification-principle">The Verification Principle</h2>
<p>A helpful guideline when using AI tools is what we might call the
“verification principle”: the importance of an AI-generated response
should be proportional to your verification efforts.</p>
<p>In other words: - For low-stakes brainstorming or first drafts, you
might accept AI output with minimal verification - For moderate-stakes
content, you should review AI suggestions carefully and make your own
judgments - For high-stakes decisions or factual claims, you should
independently verify information through reliable sources</p>
<p>This principle helps you use AI efficiently while managing the risks
associated with its limitations.</p>
<h2 id="the-complementary-mindset">The Complementary Mindset</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most productive way to think about AI tools is as
complementary to your own abilities—neither magical solutions to all
problems nor useless toys, but specific tools with particular strengths
and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Just as you wouldn’t use a hammer for every household task, you
shouldn’t expect AI to be the right tool for every situation. The key is
understanding when and how to use it effectively, and when to rely on
other approaches.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll put these ideas into practice with
activities designed to help you take control of your first AI
interactions and develop your skills as an AI director.</p>

<h2 id="activity-4-creative-control">Activity 4: Creative Control</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Practice maintaining ownership of a
creative project while using AI as an assistant.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - 20-30
minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose a simple creative project from the options below (or
create your own):</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a short story (300-500 words)</li>
<li>Plan a themed dinner party</li>
<li>Design a flyer for a community event</li>
<li>Create a workout routine</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Begin by defining your vision for the project. Write down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main goal or purpose</li>
<li>Key elements you want to include</li>
<li>Your personal style or preferences</li>
<li>Any constraints or requirements</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create a series of specific requests for ChatGPT that will help
you with different aspects of your project. Instead of asking it to
complete the entire project, break it down into components where AI
assistance would be helpful. For example, if writing a short story:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Suggest three possible opening paragraphs for a story about…”</li>
<li>“Help me develop the main character who is…”</li>
<li>“Provide some descriptive language for the setting of…”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For each AI response, select elements you like, modify others,
and discard those that don’t fit your vision.</p></li>
<li><p>Assemble the final project yourself, integrating AI-assisted
elements with your own contributions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How did breaking the project into specific requests help you
maintain creative control?</li>
<li>Which parts of the process benefited most from AI assistance?</li>
<li>Which aspects required your human judgment and creativity?</li>
<li>How does the final result reflect your vision and style, despite
using AI assistance?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="activity-5-setting-your-ai-compass">Activity 5: Setting Your AI
Compass</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop personal guidelines for how you
want to use AI in your life.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - Paper and
pen, or digital document - 15-20 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Reflect on your values, goals, and the areas of your life where
you think AI tools might be helpful. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types of tasks do you find draining or time-consuming?</li>
<li>What skills would you like to develop, with AI as a learning
aid?</li>
<li>What aspects of your thinking or work would you never want to
outsource?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ask ChatGPT for assistance in thinking through these questions
with a prompt like:</p>
<p><em>“I’m developing personal guidelines for how I want to use AI
tools like you in my life. Can you help me think through some questions
to consider about where AI might be most helpful to me and where I might
want to be cautious about using it? Consider aspects like learning,
creativity, critical thinking, and practical tasks.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Based on the AI’s suggestions and your own reflection, draft 3-5
personal guidelines for your AI use. These might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types of tasks you’ll use AI for</li>
<li>Boundaries you’ll maintain</li>
<li>How you’ll verify or evaluate AI-generated content</li>
<li>When you’ll rely on purely human approaches</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Share your draft guidelines with ChatGPT and ask for
feedback:</p>
<p><em>“Here are my draft guidelines for using AI. Can you suggest any
considerations I might have overlooked or ways to make these guidelines
more practical?”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Finalize your guidelines based on this feedback, keeping what
resonates and discarding what doesn’t fit your values and
needs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What did you learn about your own priorities through this
exercise?</li>
<li>Were there any suggestions from the AI that surprised you or made
you reconsider your approach?</li>
<li>How might these guidelines evolve as you gain more experience with
AI tools?</li>
<li>How do these guidelines reflect your understanding of Actual
Intelligence as a human-AI partnership?</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities provide a starting point for developing your skills
as an AI director—someone who effectively combines human judgment with
AI capabilities. As you practice, you’ll become more adept at providing
clear direction, evaluating AI responses critically, and maintaining
ownership of your goals and processes.</p>
<p>Remember that the concept of Actual Intelligence emphasizes that
you—the human—are the essential intelligence in this partnership. The AI
is a tool that amplifies your thinking, but the direction, purpose, and
wisdom come from you.</p>
<p>In the chapters ahead, we’ll build on these foundations by exploring
more specific applications and advanced techniques for using AI tools
effectively in various aspects of your life.</p>
