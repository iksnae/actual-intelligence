<h1 id="chapter-1-actual-intelligence---the-human-side-of-ai">Chapter 1:
Actual Intelligence - The Human Side of AI</h1>
<p>Welcome to the first chapter of “Actual Intelligence,” where we’ll
establish the fundamental principle that will guide our entire journey:
AI is merely a tool, and the real intelligence—the “Actual
Intelligence”—comes from you, the human using it.</p>
<p>In a world increasingly filled with headlines about artificial
intelligence, it’s easy to feel intimidated or even threatened by these
seemingly magical technologies. But the truth is both simpler and more
empowering: these tools are powerful extensions of human capabilities,
not replacements for human intelligence.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll explore the relationship between human
intelligence and AI tools like ChatGPT, helping you understand both in
non-technical terms. We’ll clarify what these tools can and cannot do,
dispel common misconceptions, and establish a framework for thinking
about the human-AI partnership that puts you firmly in control.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we’ll introduce practical activities that help you
take the driver’s seat in your AI interactions from day one. These
hands-on exercises will demonstrate how your direction, judgment, and
creativity remain essential when working with AI tools.</p>
<p>By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a clear understanding of what
we mean by “Actual Intelligence” and why your role as the human director
of AI tools is so crucial to getting valuable results. You’ll also have
experienced firsthand how the quality of your direction directly impacts
the usefulness of AI outputs.</p>
<p>Let’s begin our journey toward becoming confident, effective
directors of these powerful tools, rather than passive consumers of
whatever they produce.</p>
<h1
id="activities-taking-control-of-your-first-ai-interactions">Activities:
Taking Control of Your First AI Interactions</h1>
<p>Now that we’ve established the foundation of Actual Intelligence—the
powerful partnership between your human judgment and AI
capabilities—let’s put these concepts into practice with hands-on
activities. These exercises are designed to help you develop your skills
as an AI director while experiencing firsthand the importance of your
role in guiding these tools.</p>
<h2 id="activity-1-the-directors-chair">Activity 1: The Director’s
Chair</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Experience how the specificity of your
direction affects AI output.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT (free account)
- 10-15 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Open ChatGPT and start a new conversation.</p></li>
<li><p>First, give a vague prompt and observe the response: <em>“Give me
some advice.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Now, try a slightly more specific prompt: <em>“Give me some
advice about learning new skills.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, provide a highly specific prompt with context,
constraints, and your goal: <em>“I’m a busy parent with two young
children trying to learn basic Spanish in preparation for a family trip
to Mexico in three months. I can only practice for about 15 minutes each
day, usually while commuting on public transportation. Give me a
realistic learning plan that fits these constraints and focuses on
practical travel phrases.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Compare the three responses. Notice how the quality and
usefulness of the AI’s output directly corresponds to the specificity of
your direction.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong> - Which response was most
useful to you, and why? - What specific elements of your detailed prompt
led to improvements in the AI’s response? - How might you apply this
principle of specificity to your own goals when using AI?</p>
<h2 id="activity-2-intelligence-amplifier">Activity 2: Intelligence
Amplifier</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Use AI as a thinking partner to amplify
your own intelligence on a personal challenge.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - A real
problem or challenge you’re currently facing - 15-20 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Identify a current challenge in your life that requires some
thinking or planning. This could be a decision you need to make, a
project you’re planning, or a problem you’re trying to solve. Choose
something real but not extremely personal or sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>Before consulting AI, spend 3-5 minutes writing down your own
thoughts about the challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes this challenging?</li>
<li>What approaches have you considered?</li>
<li>What constraints or considerations are important?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Now, craft a prompt that asks the AI to help you think through
this challenge. Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief description of the situation</li>
<li>Your current thoughts and approaches</li>
<li>What specific type of help you want (brainstorming, organizing your
thoughts, considering perspectives you might have missed, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Review the AI’s response and identify at least one insight or
idea you hadn’t fully considered.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow up with at least one clarifying question or request based
on the AI’s response.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong> - How did the AI’s response
compare to your initial thinking? - Did the AI help you see the problem
from new angles? - How did your specific knowledge of the situation help
you evaluate the AI’s suggestions? - What role did you play versus what
role did the AI play in this thinking partnership?</p>
<h2 id="activity-3-myth-vs.-reality">Activity 3: Myth vs. Reality</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Test the limitations of AI to better
understand where human intelligence remains essential.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - Access to
reliable information sources (websites, books, experts) - 20-30
minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose a topic you know well—perhaps related to your profession,
a hobby, or your local community.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask ChatGPT a series of increasingly specific questions about
this topic, starting with general questions and moving toward highly
specific ones that might require very recent or specialized
knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Note which questions the AI answers accurately and which ones it
struggles with or provides incorrect information for.</p></li>
<li><p>For at least one question where the AI provided incorrect or
incomplete information, verify the correct information through reliable
sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the AI to explain its limitations regarding this topic. A
prompt like this works well: “What limitations might you have in
providing information about [your topic]? What aspects of this subject
would be difficult for you to address accurately?”</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong> - At what point did the AI’s
knowledge or accuracy begin to break down? - What types of questions
seemed most challenging for the AI? - How transparent was the AI about
its limitations? - How would you approach using AI for this topic in the
future, knowing these limitations?</p>
<h2 id="activity-4-creative-control">Activity 4: Creative Control</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Practice maintaining ownership of a
creative project while using AI as an assistant.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - 20-30
minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose a simple creative project from the options below (or
create your own):</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a short story (300-500 words)</li>
<li>Plan a themed dinner party</li>
<li>Design a flyer for a community event</li>
<li>Create a workout routine</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Begin by defining your vision for the project. Write down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main goal or purpose</li>
<li>Key elements you want to include</li>
<li>Your personal style or preferences</li>
<li>Any constraints or requirements</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create a series of specific requests for ChatGPT that will help
you with different aspects of your project. Instead of asking it to
complete the entire project, break it down into components where AI
assistance would be helpful. For example, if writing a short story:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Suggest three possible opening paragraphs for a story about…”</li>
<li>“Help me develop the main character who is…”</li>
<li>“Provide some descriptive language for the setting of…”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For each AI response, select elements you like, modify others,
and discard those that don’t fit your vision.</p></li>
<li><p>Assemble the final project yourself, integrating AI-assisted
elements with your own contributions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong> - How did breaking the project
into specific requests help you maintain creative control? - Which parts
of the process benefited most from AI assistance? - Which aspects
required your human judgment and creativity? - How does the final result
reflect your vision and style, despite using AI assistance?</p>
<h2 id="activity-5-setting-your-ai-compass">Activity 5: Setting Your AI
Compass</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop personal guidelines for how you
want to use AI in your life.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - Paper and
pen, or digital document - 15-20 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Reflect on your values, goals, and the areas of your life where
you think AI tools might be helpful. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>What types of tasks do you find draining or time-consuming?</li>
<li>What skills would you like to develop, with AI as a learning
aid?</li>
<li>What aspects of your thinking or work would you never want to
outsource?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Ask ChatGPT for assistance in thinking through these questions
with a prompt like: <em>“I’m developing personal guidelines for how I
want to use AI tools like you in my life. Can you help me think through
some questions to consider about where AI might be most helpful to me
and where I might want to be cautious about using it? Consider aspects
like learning, creativity, critical thinking, and practical
tasks.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Based on the AI’s suggestions and your own reflection, draft 3-5
personal guidelines for your AI use. These might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types of tasks you’ll use AI for</li>
<li>Boundaries you’ll maintain</li>
<li>How you’ll verify or evaluate AI-generated content</li>
<li>When you’ll rely on purely human approaches</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Share your draft guidelines with ChatGPT and ask for feedback:
<em>“Here are my draft guidelines for using AI. Can you suggest any
considerations I might have overlooked or ways to make these guidelines
more practical?”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Finalize your guidelines based on this feedback, keeping what
resonates and discarding what doesn’t fit your values and
needs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong> - What did you learn about
your own priorities through this exercise? - Were there any suggestions
from the AI that surprised you or made you reconsider your approach? -
How might these guidelines evolve as you gain more experience with AI
tools? - How do these guidelines reflect your understanding of Actual
Intelligence as a human-AI partnership?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These activities provide a starting point for developing your skills
as an AI director—someone who effectively combines human judgment with
AI capabilities. As you practice, you’ll become more adept at providing
clear direction, evaluating AI responses critically, and maintaining
ownership of your goals and processes.</p>
<p>Remember that the concept of Actual Intelligence emphasizes that
you—the human—are the essential intelligence in this partnership. The AI
is a tool that amplifies your thinking, but the direction, purpose, and
wisdom come from you.</p>
<p>In the chapters ahead, we’ll build on these foundations by exploring
more specific applications and advanced techniques for using AI tools
effectively in various aspects of your life.</p>
