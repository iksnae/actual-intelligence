Actual Intelligence - The Human Side of AI</h1>
<p>Have you ever watched someone use a new technology and make it look
effortless, only to feel lost when you try it yourself? Or perhaps
you’ve heard about ChatGPT and other AI tools in the news but haven’t
tried them yet, unsure if they’re too complicated or technical for
you?</p>
<figure>
<img src="./images/human-ai-partnership.jpg"
alt="A person looking hesitantly at a computer screen showing an AI interface" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A person looking hesitantly at a computer
screen showing an AI interface</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You’re not alone. Many people find these technologies intimidating or
aren’t sure where to start. The good news is that you don’t need to be a
tech expert to use these tools effectively. In fact, the most important
skills you’ll need are ones you already have—curiosity, judgment, and
your own unique perspective on what matters.</p>
<p>That’s what this book is all about: showing you how to pair your
human wisdom with AI tools to accomplish things that matter to you. We
call this partnership “Actual Intelligence,” and it puts you—not the
technology—at the center of the experience.</p>
<h2 id="quick-self-reflection">Quick Self-Reflection</h2>
<p>Before we dive in, take a moment to jot down your answers to these
questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What’s one task in your daily life or work that feels repetitive or
time-consuming?</li>
<li>What’s one topic you’ve been curious about but haven’t had time to
explore deeply?</li>
<li>What’s one creative project you’ve wanted to try but haven’t gotten
around to?</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="images/reflection-notebook.jpg"
alt="A notebook with space for answering reflection questions" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A notebook with space for answering
reflection questions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Keep these answers handy—they’ll help us personalize your first AI
experiences as we move through this chapter.</p>
<p>In the pages ahead, we’ll establish a simple framework for thinking
about AI tools, demonstrate how easily you can start using them (no
technical knowledge required!), and show you why your direction and
judgment are the critical ingredients for getting valuable results.</p>
<p>Let’s begin our journey toward becoming confident, effective
directors of these powerful tools—starting from the very first
interaction.</p>
<hr />
<div style="page-break-after: always;">

</div>
<h1 id="what-is-actual-intelligence-the-human-ai-partnership">What is
“Actual Intelligence”? (The Human-AI Partnership)</h1>
<h2 id="your-first-ai-conversation-a-guided-tour">Your First AI
Conversation: A Guided Tour</h2>
<p>Let’s start with something simple. No technical skills required—just
the ability to type a sentence.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open ChatGPT (we’ll show you exactly how in the next chapter)</li>
<li>Type exactly this: “Hi, I’m new to ChatGPT. Can you explain what you
can help me with in simple terms?”</li>
<li>Press Enter and read the response</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! You’ve just had your first AI conversation.</p>
<p><img src="images/first-conversation.png" /></p>
<p>Notice how the AI introduces itself and explains its capabilities.
This isn’t a pre-recorded message—the AI is generating this response
specifically for you. In the coming chapters, you’ll learn how to make
these conversations increasingly useful for your specific needs.</p>
<p>Maria, a small business owner with no technical background, described
her first experience: “I was honestly expecting it to be
complicated—like I’d need to learn special commands or something. But it
was just like texting. I asked how to write a better email newsletter,
and within seconds I had ideas I could actually use. No technical
jargon, no complicated setup.”</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-human-ai-partnership">Understanding the
Human-AI Partnership</h2>
<p>Think of AI tools like kitchen appliances. A stand mixer can do the
hard work of mixing dough, but it doesn’t decide what recipe to make or
know when the consistency is just right—that’s your job. The mixer is
very good at its specific task, but you’re the one with the taste buds,
the creativity to modify recipes, and the knowledge of whether you’re
baking for someone with dietary restrictions.</p>
<p><img src="images/kitchen-analogy.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Actual Intelligence</strong> is this partnership between your
human judgment and AI’s capabilities. It’s what happens when your
wisdom, creativity, and purpose combine with AI’s ability to process
information and generate content.</p>
<p>Think about the last time you used a powerful tool to solve a
problem. Maybe it was a food processor that cut your prep time in half,
or mapping software that helped you navigate an unfamiliar city. The
tool was invaluable, but you were the one who decided what to cook or
where to go. That’s exactly your relationship with AI—you’re not just
pushing buttons, you’re the creative director calling the shots.</p>
<p><img src="images/human-ai-partnership.png" /></p>
<h3 id="the-partnership-model">The Partnership Model</h3>
<p>Rather than thinking of AI as some magical entity with a mind of its
own, consider this simple relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You</strong> provide the goals, values, creativity, and
judgment</li>
<li><strong>AI</strong> provides computational power, information
access, and task assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>Why does this relationship matter so much? Because understanding it
transforms how you’ll use these tools every single day.</p>
<p>When you recognize that you’re the director and AI is your assistant,
you naturally take charge of the process instead of passively accepting
whatever the AI produces. You develop clearer expectations about what
these tools can (and can’t) do for you. You focus on strengthening the
uniquely human skills that AI can’t replicate. And perhaps most
importantly, you maintain ownership of your work and ideas.</p>
<p>Isn’t that a more empowering way to approach these tools?</p>
<h3 id="the-human-element-in-action">The Human Element in Action</h3>
<p>Let’s see this partnership in action through a real example.</p>
<p>Lisa, a middle school science teacher with no previous AI experience,
wanted to create a lesson on climate change. She could have simply asked
ChatGPT to “create a climate change lesson for 7th graders” and used
whatever it generated—but that would have ignored her unique knowledge
of her students.</p>
<p><img src="images/teacher-example.png" /></p>
<p>Instead, Lisa applied her human judgment. She knew her specific
students—their knowledge levels, interests, and the local environmental
issues they see every day. She understood which concepts they’d
struggled with in past lessons.</p>
<p>With this context that no AI could possess, Lisa directed ChatGPT
with a more specific request: “Help me create an interactive
demonstration that shows how greenhouse gases work, suitable for 7th
graders who have already learned about the water cycle but struggle with
abstract concepts.”</p>
<p>The resulting lesson was far more effective because it combined
Lisa’s understanding of her students with the AI’s ability to generate
creative teaching ideas. That’s Actual Intelligence at work—you remain
central to the process while leveraging AI as a powerful tool.</p>
<h2 id="creating-your-first-personalized-prompt">Creating Your First
Personalized Prompt</h2>
<p>Now it’s your turn. Let’s create a prompt that’s specifically
relevant to you. Fill in the blanks below:</p>
<p>“I work as a _____________ and one challenge I often face is
_____________. Could you suggest three ways I might approach this
problem?”</p>
<p><img src="images/prompt-template.png" /></p>
<p>For example: * “I work as a retail manager and one challenge I often
face is scheduling staff efficiently. Could you suggest three ways I
might approach this problem?” * “I work as a parent and one challenge I
often face is finding educational activities for rainy days. Could you
suggest three ways I might approach this problem?”</p>
<p>In the next sections, we’ll explore what makes human intelligence
unique and how it complements AI capabilities. But remember, you don’t
need to understand all the technical details to start using these tools
effectively today.</p>
<hr />
<div style="page-break-after: always;">

</div>
<h1
id="ai-tools-vs.-human-intelligence-understanding-the-relationship">AI
Tools vs. Human Intelligence: Understanding the Relationship</h1>
<p>You might be wondering: “Do I need to learn coding or computer
science to use these AI tools effectively?”</p>
<p>The simple answer is no. Using AI tools like ChatGPT requires no more
technical skill than using a search engine or sending a text message. If
you can type a question, you can use AI.</p>
<p><img src="images/simple-interface.png" /></p>
<p>What matters far more than technical knowledge is your ability to: *
Ask clear questions about topics that matter to you * Evaluate whether
the answers make sense for your situation * Follow up when you need more
details or a different approach</p>
<p>These are human skills you’ve been developing your entire life—and
they’re exactly what makes you the “Actual Intelligence” in the
partnership.</p>
<p>To use AI tools effectively, it helps to understand what makes human
intelligence different from artificial intelligence, and why that
difference creates such a powerful partnership.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-human-intelligence-unique">What Makes Human
Intelligence Unique</h2>
<p>Human intelligence has several qualities that current AI systems
simply don’t possess, despite their impressive capabilities:</p>
<h3 id="purpose-and-meaning">Purpose and Meaning</h3>
<p>Humans don’t just do things—we do things for reasons. We ask “why”
questions, set goals based on our values, and feel satisfaction when we
accomplish something meaningful. We care deeply about the purpose behind
an activity, not just getting it done.</p>
<p>AI systems, by contrast, have no intrinsic purposes or desires. They
don’t “want” anything—they simply process inputs and generate outputs.
Any sense of purpose must come from the humans using them.</p>
<p><img src="images/purpose-meaning.png" /></p>
<h3 id="real-world-understanding">Real-World Understanding</h3>
<p>Think about your rich understanding of the world, built through lived
experience. You know how it feels when you’re caught in the rain without
an umbrella. You understand the emotional weight of receiving unexpected
good news. You grasp the subtle social dynamics of a family
gathering.</p>
<p>AI systems like ChatGPT have been trained on vast amounts of text
that describe the world, but they’ve never actually lived in it. They’ve
“read” about ice cream but never tasted it. They can describe what it’s
like to be caught in the rain, but they’ve never felt that sudden cold
splash or made that mad dash for cover. It’s like the difference between
reading a travel guide and actually visiting a place—no matter how
detailed the guide, there’s something essential about the experience
that just can’t be captured in words.</p>
<h3 id="creativity-and-intuition">Creativity and Intuition</h3>
<p>Elena, a retired art teacher, was skeptical about using AI for her
watercolor hobby. “I didn’t see how a computer program could help with
something as personal as art,” she said. But when she asked ChatGPT for
suggestions on painting autumn leaves with more vibrancy, she was
pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p><img src="images/artist-example.png" /></p>
<p>“The techniques it suggested were solid fundamentals—things I might
tell my own students. But I still had to apply my eye for color, my
sense of composition, and my own aesthetic preferences. The AI gave me
options to consider, but the creative decisions remained mine.”</p>
<p>This illustrates another key difference: human creativity often
involves making unexpected connections, being inspired by seemingly
unrelated ideas, or having sudden insights that can’t be fully
explained. Our intuition allows us to make judgment calls based on
subtle cues and years of experience.</p>
<p>While AI can recombine existing ideas in impressive ways, it doesn’t
have the spark of genuine inspiration or the intuitive sense that allows
humans to make leaps beyond what’s explicitly known.</p>
<h2 id="what-ai-tools-do-well">What AI Tools Do Well</h2>
<p>These differences aren’t weaknesses—they’re the foundation of a
powerful partnership. AI and humans are like teammates with
complementary strengths.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re researching a health condition that affects someone
you love. You could spend weeks reading medical journals, trying to
understand complex terminology and conflicting studies. Or you could ask
an AI to summarize the current research, explain key terms, and
highlight treatment options—all in minutes. This is where AI truly
shines: processing vast amounts of information that would overwhelm even
the most dedicated human reader.</p>
<p><img src="images/information-processing.png" /></p>
<p>AI excels at:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Information Processing</strong>: Quickly synthesizing
enormous amounts of information and finding patterns across vast
datasets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistent Output</strong>: Working tirelessly without
getting bored, distracted, or emotional.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rapid Idea Generation</strong>: Producing multiple
options, drafts, or approaches to a problem in seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning from Patterns</strong>: Identifying trends and
connections in data that humans might otherwise miss.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-director-and-the-assistant">The Director and the
Assistant</h2>
<p>A helpful way to understand this relationship is to think of yourself
as a film director and AI as your assistant.</p>
<p><img src="images/director-assistant.png" /></p>
<p>As the director, you: * Determine the vision and purpose of the
project * Make creative and ethical decisions * Evaluate quality based
on your taste and judgment * Take ultimate responsibility for the final
product</p>
<p>The AI assistant: * Helps execute specific tasks * Offers options
based on your direction * Provides information and suggestions * Works
tirelessly on the details you specify</p>
<p>Without the director, the assistant would have no purpose or
direction. Without the assistant, the director would have to handle
every small detail alone.</p>
<p>So what does this look like in practice? Let’s see how Marcus, a
small business owner with no technical background, puts this partnership
into action.</p>
<p>Marcus owns a successful bakery and is considering opening a second
location. Instead of simply asking AI, “Where should I open my second
bakery location?”—a question the AI couldn’t possibly answer well
without knowing his specific business—Marcus directs the AI with more
specific prompts:</p>
<p><img src="images/bakery-example.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>“What demographic data should I analyze when selecting a new bakery
location?”</li>
<li>“Help me create a checklist for evaluating potential retail spaces
for a bakery.”</li>
<li>“What are typical challenges bakeries face when opening a second
location?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the pattern here—each question taps into the AI’s ability to
organize information while keeping Marcus firmly in the decision-making
role. The AI provides valuable frameworks and information, but Marcus
makes the final decision based on factors only he can fully
understand—his appetite for risk, his intuition about different
neighborhoods, and his vision for his brand.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll explore in simple terms how these AI tools
actually work, which will help you understand their capabilities and
limitations without requiring any technical background.</p>

<h1
id="how-modern-ai-tools-work-simplified-for-non-technical-readers">How
Modern AI Tools Work (Simplified for Non-Technical Readers)</h1>
<p>To effectively direct AI tools, you don’t need to understand all the
technical details—just as you don’t need to know exactly how a car
engine functions to drive effectively. However, having a basic
conceptual understanding will help you set realistic expectations and
use these tools more skillfully.</p>
<p>Let’s explore how AI tools like ChatGPT work, using simple analogies
that highlight both their capabilities and limitations.</p>
<p>“When I first heard about AI, I imagined something from science
fiction movies—like a computer that thinks and feels,” says James, a
retiree who now uses ChatGPT daily to help with his genealogy hobby.
“But once I started using it, I realized it’s more like having a very
well-read research assistant who’s incredibly fast but needs careful
direction.”</p>
<p><img src="images/senior-genealogy.png" /></p>
<h2 id="the-pattern-completion-machine">The Pattern Completion
Machine</h2>
<p>At its core, an AI like ChatGPT is a sophisticated pattern completion
machine. Imagine you’re playing a game with a friend where you start a
sentence and they finish it:</p>
<p>You say: “The chef put the cake in the…”</p>
<p>Your friend almost certainly responds: “oven”</p>
<p>Why? Because based on all the language they’ve encountered throughout
their life, “oven” is the most likely word to come next in this
context.</p>
<p>ChatGPT does something similar, but on a much larger scale. It’s been
trained on enormous amounts of text from books, articles, websites, and
other sources. During this training, it learned to recognize patterns in
how words and ideas typically follow one another.</p>
<p><img src="images/pattern-matcher.png" /></p>
<p>Think of it like a musician who has listened to thousands of songs
but doesn’t actually understand music theory. When you hum a few notes,
the musician can continue the melody based on similar patterns they’ve
heard before. They’re not composing something truly original—they’re
drawing on all the music they’ve absorbed to continue the pattern you
started.</p>
<h2 id="the-echo-chamber-of-human-knowledge">The Echo Chamber of Human
Knowledge</h2>
<p>Another helpful way to think about these AI tools is as an echo
chamber of human knowledge. They can only reflect back information and
patterns that already exist in the data they were trained on.</p>
<p><img src="images/echo-chamber.png" /></p>
<p>If you ask ChatGPT about the French Revolution, it can provide
information because many human writers have written about this topic,
and those writings were part of its training data. But if you ask about
a completely fictional historical event that no one has written about,
it can’t provide accurate information because that pattern doesn’t exist
in its training data.</p>
<p>This means AI tools: - Can reflect existing human knowledge and
writing patterns - Cannot generate truly novel discoveries or insights
that aren’t derived from existing knowledge - May confidently present
information that seems plausible but is actually incorrect</p>
<h2 id="text-prediction-not-understanding">Text Prediction, Not
Understanding</h2>
<p>Despite its impressive ability to generate human-like text, ChatGPT
doesn’t actually “understand” the meaning of words the way humans do. It
predicts which words are likely to follow each other based on
statistical patterns, not based on connecting those words to real-world
experiences or deeper concepts.</p>
<p>Think of it like someone who has memorized a cookbook in a foreign
language without understanding what the words mean. They might be able
to recite recipes perfectly and even make reasonable substitutions based
on patterns they’ve observed, but they’ve never tasted the food, felt
the texture of the ingredients, or understood why certain techniques are
used.</p>
<p><img src="images/foreign-cookbook.png" /></p>
<p>This limitation explains why AI often struggles with: - Common sense
reasoning - Understanding the physical world - Grasping cause and effect
- Distinguishing between plausible-sounding nonsense and actual
truth</p>
<h2 id="the-probability-generator">The Probability Generator</h2>
<p>When ChatGPT generates text, it’s essentially making a series of word
choices based on probability. For each position in a sentence, it
calculates which word is most likely to come next, given the preceding
words and the overall context.</p>
<p>Imagine a game where you start a sentence, and someone has to guess
what word comes next:</p>
<p>“The chef put the cake in the…”</p>
<p>Most people would guess “oven” because that’s the most probable word
to follow in this context. AI systems do something similar, but with a
much more sophisticated understanding of language patterns and a much
larger vocabulary of possible words to choose from.</p>
<p><img src="images/probability-prediction.png" /></p>
<p>This probabilistic approach means that: - ChatGPT doesn’t have a
fixed set of responses—it generates new text each time - Responses can
vary even to identical prompts - The AI doesn’t “decide” what to say
based on reasoning—it selects words based on probability</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-you">What This Means for You</h2>
<p>Understanding these basics about how AI works helps explain both its
impressive capabilities and its surprising limitations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>It can generate human-like text</strong> because it has
learned patterns from vast amounts of human writing</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It can provide information on many topics</strong>
because it has been trained on diverse texts</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It struggles with factual accuracy</strong> because it’s
predicting plausible text, not verifying truth</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It can’t truly reason or understand</strong> because it’s
matching patterns, not comprehending meaning</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It doesn’t have experiences or goals</strong> because
it’s a text prediction system, not a conscious entity</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These characteristics make AI tools incredibly useful for certain
tasks but also highlight why human direction and judgment—your Actual
Intelligence—remains essential.</p>
<h2 id="the-assistant-not-the-expert">The Assistant, Not the Expert</h2>
<p>Given these limitations, it’s helpful to think of AI tools as
assistants rather than experts or authorities. They can help you
brainstorm, draft content, summarize information, and explore ideas, but
you should always apply your own judgment to their output.</p>
<p><img src="images/human-judgment.png" /></p>
<p>Remember Jake, who’s planning a family vacation to Japan. If he
simply asks ChatGPT “Plan my perfect Japan trip” and follows whatever
itinerary it generates, he might end up with a generic tourist
experience that doesn’t match his family’s interests or visit
attractions that are closed for renovation.</p>
<p>Instead, Jake uses his understanding of AI limitations to direct the
tool more effectively. He knows that: - The AI’s information might be
outdated - It doesn’t know his family’s specific preferences - It can’t
verify if suggested accommodations are actually available</p>
<p>So he uses AI as an assistant for specific tasks where pattern
matching is helpful—generating ideas for kid-friendly activities in
Tokyo, suggesting phrasing for basic Japanese phrases, or creating a
packing checklist—while handling the critical judgment calls himself and
verifying key information through other sources.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll explore how to take control of this
human-AI partnership to get the most value from these powerful but
limited tools.</p>

<h1 id="directing-ai-and-setting-realistic-expectations">Directing AI
and Setting Realistic Expectations</h1>
<p>Now that we understand the relationship between human intelligence
and AI capabilities, let’s focus on two critical elements that will make
your AI experiences successful: how to effectively direct these tools
and what you should realistically expect from them.</p>
<h2 id="the-directors-mindset">The Director’s Mindset</h2>
<p>Remember our film director metaphor? Let’s expand on what it means to
be an effective director of AI tools.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/director-mindset.png"
alt="A person confidently directing AI with clear purpose and vision" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A person confidently directing AI with
clear purpose and vision</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just as a film director doesn’t simply tell actors “make a good
scene” and hope for the best, you shouldn’t approach AI with vague
requests and passive acceptance of whatever it produces. The director’s
mindset involves several key practices:</p>
<h3 id="clarity-of-purpose">1. Clarity of Purpose</h3>
<p>“I used to start by asking ChatGPT vague questions and get frustrated
with the generic answers,” explains David, a small business consultant.
“Now I always take a moment to get clear on exactly what I need before I
even open the app.”</p>
<p>Before engaging with AI, ask yourself: - What specific problem am I
trying to solve? - What would a successful outcome look like? - What
constraints or requirements should I keep in mind?</p>
<p>This clarity helps you give more effective directions and evaluate
the AI’s responses more critically.</p>
<h3 id="specificity-in-direction">2. Specificity in Direction</h3>
<p>Vague prompts lead to generic responses. The more specific your
direction, the more useful the AI’s assistance will be. Compare these
approaches:</p>
<p><strong>Vague direction:</strong> “Give me some marketing ideas.”</p>
<p><strong>Specific direction:</strong> “I run a local organic farm
stand targeting health-conscious families. Suggest five low-budget
marketing approaches that would help us emphasize our sustainable
farming practices and community roots.”</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/specific-direction.png"
alt="A comparison of vague vs specific prompts and resulting outputs" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A comparison of vague vs specific prompts
and resulting outputs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The specific direction provides context and constraints that help the
AI generate relevant responses tailored to your needs.</p>
<h3 id="iterative-refinement">3. Iterative Refinement</h3>
<p>Working with AI is rarely a one-and-done process. Think of it as a
conversation rather than a single question and answer.</p>
<p>“At first I’d just accept whatever the AI gave me,” says Priya, a
freelance writer. “Now I know that the magic happens in the
back-and-forth. I’ll say ‘that’s too formal’ or ‘can you add more
examples about X’ and the results get dramatically better.”</p>
<p>Don’t settle for the first response if it doesn’t quite meet your
needs. Instead, provide feedback and additional direction to guide the
AI toward more useful outputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>“That’s helpful, but could you make it simpler?”</li>
<li>“I like the third idea best. Can you expand on that approach
specifically?”</li>
<li>“These examples are too technical. Can you rewrite them for someone
with no background in this field?”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="critical-evaluation">4. Critical Evaluation</h3>
<p>Approach AI-generated content with a healthy skepticism. Ask
yourself: - Does this information seem accurate and reliable? - Is this
the right approach for my specific situation? - Does this align with my
values and objectives?</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/critical-evaluation.png"
alt="A person evaluating AI content with a thoughtful, critical eye" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A person evaluating AI content with a
thoughtful, critical eye</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Remember that you are the ultimate judge of quality and
appropriateness. The AI is there to assist you, not make final
decisions.</p>
<h2 id="the-amplification-effect">The Amplification Effect</h2>
<p>When you combine human direction with AI capabilities, something
remarkable happens: both are amplified beyond what either could achieve
alone. This is the essence of Actual Intelligence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your creativity is amplified by the AI’s ability to quickly generate
variations and alternatives</li>
<li>Your knowledge is amplified by the AI’s ability to provide
information and perspectives you might not have considered</li>
<li>Your productivity is amplified by the AI’s ability to handle routine
aspects of tasks, freeing you to focus on higher-level thinking</li>
</ul>
<p>Sarah, a high school English teacher, experiences this amplification
when planning her curriculum. She could spend hours searching for
relevant reading materials, drafting discussion questions, and creating
assignments. Instead, she directs ChatGPT with her specific educational
goals and knowledge of her students:</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/teacher-curriculum.png"
alt="A teacher using AI to help plan curriculum while adding her own expertise" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A teacher using AI to help plan
curriculum while adding her own expertise</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>“I need to design a unit on ‘identity’ for my 10th grade English
class. Many of my students are first-generation Americans who often
discuss the challenges of navigating between cultures. Suggest
contemporary short stories from diverse authors that explore identity
formation, and for each story, outline potential discussion questions
that connect to the immigrant experience.”</p>
<p>With this direction, ChatGPT can quickly generate suggestions that
Sarah then evaluates based on her professional judgment, knowledge of
her specific students, and curriculum requirements. She might accept
some suggestions, modify others, and reject those that don’t fit her
vision.</p>
<p>The result is a curriculum that reflects Sarah’s expertise and
understanding of her students, but was developed more efficiently and
with a broader range of perspectives than she might have managed working
entirely on her own. That’s Actual Intelligence at work.</p>
<h2 id="setting-realistic-expectations">Setting Realistic
Expectations</h2>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in working effectively with AI tools is
setting realistic expectations. Media hype often presents AI as either
magical thinking machines or imminent threats to humanity—neither of
which accurately reflects the reality of current tools like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>“I was honestly intimidated by all the news about AI,” admits Raj, a
retired accountant. “I expected it to either be impossibly complex to
use or creepily human-like. The reality was much more
down-to-earth—helpful in some ways, limited in others.”</p>
<p>Let’s establish a balanced understanding of what these tools can and
cannot do to help you use them more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="what-ai-tools-can-do-well">What AI Tools Can Do Well</h3>
<h4 id="generate-human-like-text">Generate Human-Like Text</h4>
<p>AI excels at producing various types of written content—from creative
writing to technical explanations, from casual conversation to formal
documents. It can adapt its tone, style, and complexity level based on
your direction.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/text-generation.png"
alt="Examples of different text styles AI can generate" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Examples of different text styles AI can
generate</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="process-and-summarize-information">Process and Summarize
Information</h4>
<p>AI can take large amounts of information and distill it into
summaries, key points, or structured formats that are easier to
understand and use.</p>
<h4 id="brainstorm-ideas-and-alternatives">Brainstorm Ideas and
Alternatives</h4>
<p>AI can quickly generate multiple options, perspectives, or approaches
to a problem, helping you explore possibilities you might not have
considered on your own.</p>
<h4 id="draft-and-edit-content">Draft and Edit Content</h4>
<p>AI can create initial drafts of many types of content and help
improve existing text by suggesting edits, reorganization, or
alternative phrasing.</p>
<h4 id="explain-concepts-at-various-levels">Explain Concepts at Various
Levels</h4>
<p>AI can explain complex topics in simpler terms or provide more
detailed explanations of basic concepts, adapting to different knowledge
levels and learning needs.</p>
<h4 id="simulate-conversations-and-perspectives">Simulate Conversations
and Perspectives</h4>
<p>AI can role-play different viewpoints or expertise areas, allowing
you to explore how different people might approach a situation.</p>
<h3 id="what-ai-tools-cannot-do-well">What AI Tools Cannot Do Well</h3>
<h4 id="verify-factual-accuracy">Verify Factual Accuracy</h4>
<p>AI language models don’t have the ability to independently verify
facts. They can confidently present incorrect information (sometimes
called “hallucinations”) that sounds plausible but is actually
wrong.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/hallucination.png"
alt="An illustration showing AI presenting incorrect information confidently" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An illustration showing AI presenting
incorrect information confidently</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="provide-up-to-date-information">Provide Up-to-Date
Information</h4>
<p>AI training data has a cutoff date, after which the model has no
knowledge of world events, new products, or recent developments unless
specifically updated.</p>
<h4 id="access-your-personal-information">Access Your Personal
Information</h4>
<p>AI doesn’t know who you are, your personal history, or your specific
circumstances unless you explicitly share this information in your
conversation.</p>
<h4 id="perform-actions-in-the-real-world">Perform Actions in the Real
World</h4>
<p>AI language models can’t directly access the internet, run programs,
or interact with other systems unless specifically integrated with those
capabilities.</p>
<h4 id="exercise-true-judgment-or-wisdom">Exercise True Judgment or
Wisdom</h4>
<p>AI can simulate advice or opinions, but lacks the lived experience,
moral grounding, and contextual understanding needed for true wisdom or
judgment.</p>
<h4 id="create-truly-original-ideas">Create Truly Original Ideas</h4>
<p>While AI can recombine existing concepts in new ways, it doesn’t
generate truly novel ideas disconnected from its training data.</p>
<h2 id="common-misconceptions">Common Misconceptions</h2>
<p>Let’s address some frequent misconceptions about AI tools that can
lead to unrealistic expectations:</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-knows-everything">Misconception: “AI knows
everything”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI only knows what was in its training
data, and that knowledge is neither comprehensive nor always accurate.
It can present incorrect information with high confidence.</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-is-objective-and-unbiased">Misconception: “AI
is objective and unbiased”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI reflects the biases present in its
training data and those introduced by its creators. It does not have a
neutral or objective viewpoint.</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-understands-what-its-saying">Misconception: “AI
understands what it’s saying”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI generates text without genuine
comprehension. It doesn’t understand concepts the way humans do—it
predicts patterns in language without connecting them to real-world
meaning.</p>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-has-opinions-or-beliefs">Misconception: “AI has
opinions or beliefs”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> AI simulates opinions based on patterns in
its training data but doesn’t actually hold beliefs or convictions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/ai-misconceptions.png"

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A diagram dispelling common AI myths and
misconceptions</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="misconception-ai-is-always-improving-itself">Misconception: “AI
is always improving itself”</h3>
<p><strong>Reality:</strong> Most AI tools don’t learn from your
interactions unless specifically designed to do so. Your conversations
typically don’t make the AI smarter or more personalized to you over
time.</p>
<h2 id="the-verification-principle">The Verification Principle</h2>
<p>A helpful guideline when using AI tools is what we might call the
“verification principle”: the importance of an AI-generated response
should be proportional to your verification efforts.</p>
<p>In other words: - For low-stakes brainstorming or first drafts, you
might accept AI output with minimal verification - For moderate-stakes
content, you should review AI suggestions carefully and make your own
judgments - For high-stakes decisions or factual claims, you should
independently verify information through reliable sources</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/verification-principle.png"
alt="A diagram showing verification levels based on stakes" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A diagram showing verification levels
based on stakes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Michael, a hobby photographer researching camera equipment, applies
this principle: “I use ChatGPT to get quick explanations of technical
concepts and generate questions I should ask. But before spending $2,000
on a new camera, I always verify the specific model details on the
manufacturer’s website and read reviews from trusted photography
sites.”</p>
<p>This principle helps you use AI efficiently while managing the risks
associated with its limitations.</p>
<h2 id="taking-control-of-the-process">Taking Control of the
Process</h2>
<p>To fully embrace your role as the director of AI tools, consider this
general approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Define your objective</strong> clearly before engaging
with the AI</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide context and constraints</strong> that help the AI
understand your specific situation</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start with specific questions or requests</strong> rather
than open-ended prompts</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate responses critically</strong>, looking for both
useful elements and potential issues</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide feedback and refinement</strong> to guide the AI
toward more helpful responses</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate multiple sources</strong>, not relying solely
on AI-generated content</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Make the final decisions</strong> based on your judgment,
values, and knowledge</p></li>
</ol>

</ol>
<p>“I used this approach when planning a career change,” shares Tanisha,
a former retail manager now working in healthcare administration. “The
AI didn’t tell me what to do, but it helped me organize my thoughts and
consider aspects I hadn’t thought about, like what transferable skills I
already had.”</p>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How did the AI’s response compare to your initial thinking?</li>
<li>Did the AI help you see the problem from new angles?</li>
<li>How did your specific knowledge of the situation help you evaluate
the AI’s suggestions?</li>
<li>What role did you play versus what role did the AI play in this
thinking partnership?</li>

<h2 id="activity-3-myth-vs.-reality">Activity 3: Myth vs. Reality</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Test the limitations of AI to better
understand where human intelligence remains essential.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - Access to
reliable information sources (websites, books, experts) - 20-30
minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose a topic you know well—perhaps related to your profession, a
hobby, or your local community.</li>
</ol>

own knowledge on a familiar topic</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Ask ChatGPT a series of increasingly specific questions about
this topic, starting with general questions and moving toward highly
specific ones that might require very recent or specialized
knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Note which questions the AI answers accurately and which ones it
struggles with or provides incorrect information for.</p></li>
<li><p>For at least one question where the AI provided incorrect or
incomplete information, verify the correct information through reliable
sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the AI to explain its limitations regarding this topic. A
prompt like this works well:</p>
<p><em>“What limitations might you have in providing information about
[your topic]? What aspects of this subject would be difficult for you to
address accurately?”</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Robert, an amateur astronomer, tried this with his hobby: “I was
impressed with the AI’s knowledge of basic astronomy concepts, but when
I asked about specific deep-sky objects I’ve observed or recent
discoveries, it either gave outdated information or made up details. It
was actually quite honest about its limitations when I asked
directly.”</p>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>At what point did the AI’s knowledge or accuracy begin to break
down?</li>
<li>What types of questions seemed most challenging for the AI?</li>
<li>How transparent was the AI about its limitations?</li>
<li>How would you approach using AI for this topic in the future,
knowing these limitations?</li>

<h2 id="activity-4-creative-control">Activity 4: Creative Control</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Practice maintaining ownership of a
creative project while using AI as an assistant.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - 20-30
minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose a simple creative project from the options below (or create
your own):
<ul>
<li>Write a short story (300-500 words)</li>
<li>Plan a themed dinner party</li>
<li>Design a flyer for a community event</li>
<li>Create a workout routine</li>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Begin by defining your vision for the project. Write down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main goal or purpose</li>
<li>Key elements you want to include</li>
<li>Your personal style or preferences</li>
<li>Any constraints or requirements</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Create a series of specific requests for ChatGPT that will help
you with different aspects of your project. Instead of asking it to
complete the entire project, break it down into components where AI
assistance would be helpful. For example, if writing a short story:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Suggest three possible opening paragraphs for a story about…”</li>
<li>“Help me develop the main character who is…”</li>
<li>“Provide some descriptive language for the setting of…”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For each AI response, select elements you like, modify others,
and discard those that don’t fit your vision.</p></li>
<li><p>Assemble the final project yourself, integrating AI-assisted
elements with your own contributions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“I used this approach to plan my daughter’s birthday party,” explains
Wei, a busy parent. “I had a dinosaur theme in mind but needed help with
game ideas and decorations. Instead of asking for a complete party plan,
I asked specific questions about each aspect and pieced together the
elements I liked. The party felt like my creation, not something an AI
made.”</p>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How did breaking the project into specific requests help you
maintain creative control?</li>
<li>Which parts of the process benefited most from AI assistance?</li>
<li>Which aspects required your human judgment and creativity?</li>
<li>How does the final result reflect your vision and style, despite
using AI assistance?</li>

<h2 id="activity-5-setting-your-ai-compass">Activity 5: Setting Your AI
Compass</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop personal guidelines for how you
want to use AI in your life.</p>
<p><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong> - Access to ChatGPT - Paper and
pen, or digital document - 15-20 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Reflect on your values, goals, and the areas of your life where you
think AI tools might be helpful. Consider:
<ul>
<li>What types of tasks do you find draining or time-consuming?</li>
<li>What skills would you like to develop, with AI as a learning
aid?</li>
<li>What aspects of your thinking or work would you never want to
outsource?</li>
</ul></li>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">A person reflecting on personal values
and creating AI usage guidelines</figcaption>
</figure>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Ask ChatGPT for assistance in thinking through these questions
with a prompt like:</p>
<p><em>“I’m developing personal guidelines for how I want to use AI
tools like you in my life. Can you help me think through some questions
to consider about where AI might be most helpful to me and where I might
want to be cautious about using it? Consider aspects like learning,
creativity, critical thinking, and practical tasks.”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Based on the AI’s suggestions and your own reflection, draft 3-5
personal guidelines for your AI use. These might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types of tasks you’ll use AI for</li>
<li>Boundaries you’ll maintain</li>
<li>How you’ll verify or evaluate AI-generated content</li>
<li>When you’ll rely on purely human approaches</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Share your draft guidelines with ChatGPT and ask for
feedback:</p>
<p><em>“Here are my draft guidelines for using AI. Can you suggest any
considerations I might have overlooked or ways to make these guidelines
more practical?”</em></p></li>
<li><p>Finalize your guidelines based on this feedback, keeping what
resonates and discarding what doesn’t fit your values and
needs.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“This exercise helped me set healthy boundaries,” says Gabriela, a
freelance writer. “I realized I wanted to use AI for research and
editing but not for the creative heart of my writing. Having these
guidelines helps me use AI as a tool without feeling like I’m
compromising my craft.”</p>
<p><strong>Reflection Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What did you learn about your own priorities through this
exercise?</li>
<li>Were there any suggestions from the AI that surprised you or made
you reconsider your approach?</li>
<li>How might these guidelines evolve as you gain more experience with
AI tools?</li>
<li>How do these guidelines reflect your understanding of Actual
Intelligence as a human-AI partnership?</li>

<p>Remember that the concept of Actual Intelligence emphasizes that
you—the human—are the essential intelligence in this partnership. The AI
is a tool that amplifies your thinking, but the direction, purpose, and
wisdom come from you.</p>
<p>“Before trying these activities, I felt like AI was this mysterious
thing I couldn’t possibly understand,” shares Jordan, a small business
owner. “Now I see it’s just a tool—a powerful one, but still just a tool
that I control. That shift in perspective has made all the
difference.”</p>
<p>In the chapters ahead, we’ll build on these foundations by exploring
more specific applications and techniques for using AI tools effectively
in various aspects of your life. We’ll start by setting up your free
ChatGPT account and walking through the basics of the interface, so you
can begin applying what you’ve learned right away.</p>
<p>For now, take a moment to reflect on what you’ve discovered about the
human-AI partnership and how you might start incorporating these tools
into your life in ways that align with your goals and values.</p>
